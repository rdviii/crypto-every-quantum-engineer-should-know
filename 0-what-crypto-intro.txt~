At a conference in Berlin in June, I was asked, paraphrasing, about
why we change the cryptographic keys used during long communication
sessions, and how often they _ought_ to be changed.  I waved my hands
a little bit, but I wasn't completely satisfied with my own answer.
It turned out to be a good opportunity for me to dig into a little
background I'd been meaning to go through.  It also proved to be a
*remarkably* hard question to answer from googling up pages, including
cryptography research papers and the _extensive_ mailing list archives
from development of key Internet protocols.  I fell down a pretty
serious rabbit hole here, and haven't found my way out yet.
