abstract="Rather than use a shared key directly to cryptographically process (e.g. encrypt or authenticate) data one can use it as a master key to derive subkeys, and use the subkeys for the actual cryptographic processing. This popular paradigm is called re-keying, and the expectation is that it is good for security. In this paper we provide concrete security analyses of various re-keying mechanisms and their usage. We show that re-keying does indeed ``increase'' security, effectively extending the lifetime of the master key and bringing significant, provable security gains in practical situations. We quantify the security provided by different rekeying processes as a function of the security of the primitives they use, thereby enabling a user to choose between different re-keying processes given the constraints of some application.",

                  intensify the photons coming from the ions
                  themselves, then focused onto a small CCD.  In their
                  example, a 4x4 group of pixels is grouped into a
                  single pixel, and a 7x7 block of those is used to
                  detect each ion.  Readout time is 15msec for the
                  whole CCD right now; they claim reducing that to
                  2.5usec/ion is doable with currently available
                  CCDs.  One limit in their current setup is the waist
                  of the detection beam is about 10 microns, compared
                  to an ion spacing of 4um.  They achieved readout
                  accuracy of 98\%, and a significant part of the
                  inaccuracy is believed to be due to neighboring ions
                  influencing each other.  Done on a chain of three
                  ions, the paper includes images of binary counting
                  from 000 to 111.}

These advances have rendered the aforesaid technologies mature enough to support the realization of experiments that test the foundations of quantum theory at unprecedented scales and in the unexplored space environment. Such experiments, in fact, could explore the boundaries of quantum theory and may provide new insights to investigate phenomena where gravity affects quantum objects. Here, we review recent results in satellite quantum communications and discuss possible phenomena that could be observable with current technologies. Furthermore, stressing the fact that space represents an incredible resource to realize new experiments aimed at highlighting some physical effects, we challenge the community to propose new experiments that unveil the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity that could be realizable in the near future.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue {\textquoteleft}Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact on contemporary society{\textquoteright}.},

We consider networks where quantum communication between nodes is restricted to sending a qubit, but classical communication is unrestricted. We analyze which N-qubit unitary operations are implementable over cluster networks by investigating transformations of a given cluster network into quantum circuits. We show that any two-qubit unitary operation is implementable over the butterfly network and the grail network, which are fundamental primitive networks for classical network coding. We also analyze probabilistic implementations of unitary operations over cluster networks.},

        abstract = {Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) act autonomously for the sake of achieving the best possible performance. The attainable routing depends on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Finding the optimal solution typically becomes an NP-hard problem, as the network size increases in terms of the number of nodes. Moreover, the employment of user-defined utility functions for the aggregation of the different objective functions often leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand, Pareto Optimality is capable of amalgamating the different design objectives by providing an element of elitism. Although there is a plethora of bio-inspired algorithms that attempt to address this optimization problem, they often fail to generate all the points constituting the Optimal Pareto Front (OPF). As a remedy, we propose an optimal multi-objective quantum-assisted algorithm, namely the Non-dominated Quantum Optimization algorithm (NDQO), which evaluates  the legitimate routes using the concept of Pareto Optimality at a reduced complexity. We then compare the performance of the NDQO algorithm to the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating that the NDQO algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we analytically derive the upper and lower bounds of the NDQO algorithmic complexity, which is of the order of \$O(N)\$ and \$O(N{$\backslash$}sqrt\{N\})\$ in the best- and worst-case scenario, respectively. This corresponds to a substantial complexity reduction of the NDQO from the order of \$O(N{\^{ }}2)\$ imposed by the brute-force (BF) method.}

abstract = "Abstract The appealing feature of quantum key distribution (QKD), from a cryptographic viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, \{QKD\} however does not provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established by \{QKD\} are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating \{QKD\} in security infrastructures, to analyze how \{QKD\} can be combined with other cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment techniques, \{QKD\} being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic scenarios related to the practical use of \{QKD\} in cryptographic infrastructures: 1) using \{QKD\} as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a point-to-point link; 2) using \{QKD\} in a network containing many users with the objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the constraints as well as the potential interest of using \{QKD\} in these contexts. We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of \{QKD\} technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research. "

In this work, we consider QKD networks based on trusted repeaters from a topology viewpoint, and present a set of analytical models that can be used to optimize the spatial distribution of QKD devices and nodes in specific network configurations in order to guarantee a certain level of service to network users, at a minimum cost. We give details on new methods and original results regarding such cost minimization arguments applied to QKD networks. These results are likely to become of high importance when the deployment of QKD networks will be addressed by future quantum telecommunication operators. They will therefore have a strong impact on the design and requirements of the next generation of QKD devices.}

                  problems such as crosstalk and imperfect beam
                  splitters and "accidental counts" (two-photon, or

Suppose Alice and Bob share a bipartite state /spl rho/ which is "reasonably close" to perfect EPR pairs. The only information Alice and Bob possess is a lower bound on the fidelity of /spl rho/ and a maximally entangled state. They wish to "purify" /spl rho/ using local operations and classical communication, and output a state that is arbitrarily close to EPR pairs. We prove that, on average, Alice and Bob cannot increase the fidelity of the input state significantly. On the other hand, there exist protocols that may fail with a small probability, and otherwise will output states arbitrarily close to EPR pairs with very high probability. These protocols come from the "purity-testing protocols" of H. Barnum et al. (2001).},

Here, we demonstrate lines with an average width of 36 nanometers (nm), about one-tenth the illuminating wavelength {lambda}1 = 325 nm, made by applying a film of thermally stable photochromic molecules above the photoresist. Simultaneous irradiation of a second wavelength, {lambda}2 = 633 nm, renders the film opaque to the writing beam except at nodal sites, which let through a spatially constrained segment of incident {lambda}1 light, allowing subdiffractional patterning. The same experiment also demonstrates a patterning of periodic lines whose widths are about one-tenth their period, which is far smaller than what has been thought to be lithographically possible.

                  answer for each iteration.  The output register only
                  has to be four qubits.  Since the modification is in
                  the function, rather than the input state, I don't
                  think this translates directly to e.g. factoring.
                  Says 30-100 qubits is enough to be useful.  Quantum
                  chemistry kinds of things.}

                  bit.  No segmentation/reassembly allowed in the

                  70(13):1895–1899]. Quantum memory enables controlled
                  storage and retrieval of fast-flying photonic
                  quantum bits with stationary matter systems, which
                  is essential to achieve the scalability required for
                  large-scale quantum networks. Combining these two
                  capabilities, here we realize quantum teleportation
                  between two remote atomic-ensemble quantum memory
                  nodes, each composed of ∼108 rubidium atoms and
                  connected by a 150-m optical fiber. The spin wave
                  state of one atomic ensemble is mapped to a
                  propagating photon and subjected to Bell state
                  measurements with another single photon that is
                  entangled with the spin wave state of the other
                  ensemble. Two-photon detection events herald the
                  success of teleportation with an average fidelity of
                  88(7)\%. Besides its fundamental interest as a
                  teleportation between two remote macroscopic
                  objects, our technique may be useful for quantum
                  information transfer between different nodes in
                  quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.},

abstract = {The increasing consumption of multimedia services and the demand of high-quality services from customers has triggered a fundamental change in how we administer networks in terms of abstraction, separation, and mapping of forwarding, control and management aspects of services. The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers. Thidly, we comprehensively survey different industrial initiatives and projects that are pushing forward the adoption of SDN and NFV in accelerating 5G network slicing. A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution. The work also investigates the standardization efforts in 5G networks regarding network slicing and softwarization. Additionally, the article presents the management and orchestration of network slices in a single domain followed by a comprehensive survey of management and orchestration approaches in 5G network slicing across multiple domains while supporting multiple tenants. Furthermore, we highlight the future challenges and research directions regarding network softwarization and slicing using SDN and NFV in 5G networks.}

These entities can be either mobile by nature (e.g., human beings and animals) or mobile by design (e.g., trains, airplanes, and cars). The movements of such entities equipped with storage capabilities create a communication channel which can help overcome the limitations or the lack of conventional data networks. Common limitations include the mismatch between the capacity offered by these networks and the traffic demand or their limited deployment owing to environmental factors. Application scenarios include offloading traffic off legacy networks for capacity improvement, bridging connectivity gaps, or deploying ad hoc networks in challenging environments for coverage enhancement.},

abstract={With over 300 billion vehicle trips made in the United States and 64 billion in France per year, network operators have the opportunity to utilize the existing road and highway network as an alternative data network to offload large amounts of delay-tolerant traffic. To enable the road network as a large-capacity transmission system, we exploit the existing mobility of vehicles equipped with wireless and storage capacities together with a collection of offloading spots. An offloading spot is a data storage equipment located where vehicles usually park. Data is transloaded from a conventional data network to the closest offloading spot and then shipped by vehicles along their line of travel. The subsequent offloading spots act as data relay boxes where vehicles can drop off data for later pick-up by other vehicles, depending on their direction of travel. The main challenges of this offloading system are how to compute the road path matching the performance requirements of a data transfer and how to configure the sequence of offloading spots involved in the transfer. We propose a scalable and adaptive centralized architecture built on software-defined networking that maximizes the utilization of the flow of vehicles connecting consecutive offloading spots. We simulate the performance of our system using real roads traffic counts for France. Results show that the centralized controlled offloading architecture can achieve an efficient and fair allocation of concurrent data transfers between major cities in France.},

Our protocol is based on a chain of repeater stations, and exploits topological encoding to tolerate very high levels of defects and errors. The repeater stations may employ probabilistic entanglement operations which usually fail; ours is the first protocol to explicitly allow for technologies of this kind. Given an error rate between stations in excess of 10\%, arbitrarily long range high fidelity entanglement distribution is possible even if the heralded failure rate within the stations is as high as 99\%, providing that unheralded errors are low (order 0.01\%).}

We design an equivalent quantum circuit, by means of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates, which can perform the operation of a quantum router. Here, we show the routing of signal information in two different paths (two signal qubits), which is directed by a control qubit. According to the process of routing, the signal information is found to be in a coherent superposition of two paths. We demonstrate the quantum nature of the router by illustrating the entanglement between the control qubit and the two signal qubits (two paths) and confirm the well preservation of the signal information in either of the two paths after the routing process. We perform quantum state tomography to verify the generation of entanglement and preservation of information. It is found that the experimental results are obtained with good fidelity.",

  abstract={We present a scheme for rapidly entangling matter qubits in order to create graph states for one-way quantum computing. The qubits can be simple three-level systems in separate cavities. Coupling involves only local fields and a static (unswitched) linear optics network. Fusion of graph-state sections occurs with, in principle, zero probability of damaging the nascent graph state. We avoid the finite thresholds of other schemes by operating on two entangled pairs, so that each generates exactly one photon. We do not require the relatively slow single qubit local flips to be applied during the growth phase: growth of the graph state can then become a purely optical process. The scheme naturally generates graph states with vertices of high degree and so is easily able to construct minimal graph states, with consequent resource savings. The most efficient approach will be to create new graph-state edges even as qubits elsewhere are measured, in a 'just in time' approach. An error analysis indicates that the scheme is relatively robust against imperfections in the apparatus.}

Demonstrates how parallel scatter/gather can operate to take advantage
of multiple network links. Each segment of the transfer can be,
nominally, from any source -- memory, disk, file, network address,
network-attached peripheral data addresses, etc. Explicitly depends on
separation of control and data. Packet formats for exchange not yet
defined. Plans to support multiple transport mechanisms. ``Transport''
might not be quite the right term for this protocol -- higher in the
stack? Defines different types of segment addresses. Remapping of data
via the ``contiguous zero-based virtual address space transfer
window'' (e.g. gathered mapping) is possible. Designed to optimize
easily for simple two-party transfer. As a very general mechanism,
full implementation would be tough.}}

abstract = {Most schemes for quantum information processing require fast single-qubit operations. For spin-based qubits, this involves performing arbitrary coherent rotations of the spin state on time scales much faster than the spin coherence time. By applying off-resonant, picosecond-scale optical pulses, we demonstrated the coherent rotation of a single electron spin through arbitrary angles up to {pi} radians. We directly observed this spin manipulation using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy and found that the results are well described by a model that includes the electronnuclear spin interaction. Measurements of the spin rotation as a function of laser detuning and intensity confirmed that the optical Stark effect is the operative mechanism.

  abstract={Quantum cryptographic key distribution (QKD) uses extremely faint light pulses to carry quantum information between two parties (Alice and Bob), allowing them to generate a shared, secret cryptographic key. Autocompensating QKD systems automatically and passively compensate for uncontrolled time-dependent variations of the optical fibre properties by coding the information as a differential phase between orthogonally polarized components of a light pulse sent on a round trip through the fibre, reflected at mid-course using a Faraday mirror. We have built a prototype system based on standard telecom technology that achieves a privacy-amplified bit generation rate of \~{}1000 bits s-1 over a 10 km optical fibre link. Quantum cryptography is an example of an application that, by using quantum states of individual particles to represent information, accomplishes a practical task that is impossible using classical means.}

Our aim is to combine this classical approach with modern nanotechnology to build a nanomechanical computer (NMC) based on nanomechanical transistors. The main motivation behind constructing such a computer is threefold: (i) mechanical elements are more robust to electromagnetic shocks than current dynamic random access memory (DRAM) based purely on complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, (ii) the power dissipated can be orders of magnitude below CMOS and (iii) the operating temperature of such an NMC can be an order of magnitude above that of conventional CMOS.}

snoops the memory bus for writes and copies data from one node to

cycles have to be dedicated to each copy. Can also do low-latency
copying directly under application control. I'm not convinced that
it's particularly secure, although they assert it is -- only if you
trust all incoming network traffic, I think. Good references.},

                  by a factor of 0.7 in each three-year generation,
                  giving a halving of area every three years (coupled
                  with increasing die area, gives us twice the
                  transistors every eighteen months).  Discusses how
                  wire resistance goes up with decreasing size,
                  meaning that switching time goes down but
                  transmission time goes up.  The interconnect time
                  therefore is becoming more important, and may
                  dominate at some point soon.  Wires are already
                  taller than they are wide, and upper-layer metals,
                  which are used for long-distance interconnect, are
                  wider than lower-layer metals, where pitch is
                  important.  Briefly mentions copper and optical
                  interconnects, and GaAs.  Predicts basic Si still
                  good for 3-4 generations, but the cost of design and
                  fab will start to affect things soon.},

current system software and Paragon hardware are much faster. However,
I have some problems with some of the conclusions the paper draws,
such as their claim that the position of a compute node in the network
does not affect its I/O performance. I believe it's probably true, but
I don't think their experiments establish that at all, due to the
scattering of data in the system. Principal problem is centralized
control of specific FS objects.}}

	abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to be better at solving certain computational problems than classical computers. This expectation is based on (well-founded) conjectures in computational complexity theory, but rigorous comparisons between the capabilities of quantum and classical algorithms are difficult to perform. Bravyi et al. proved theoretically that whereas the number of {\textquotedblleft}steps{\textquotedblright} needed by parallel quantum circuits to solve certain linear algebra problems was independent of the problem size, this number grew logarithmically with size for analogous classical circuits (see the Perspective by Montanaro). This so-called quantum advantage stems from the quantum correlations present in quantum circuits that cannot be reproduced in analogous classical circuits.Science, this issue p. 308; see also p. 289Quantum effects can enhance information-processing capabilities and speed up the solution of certain computational problems. Whether a quantum advantage can be rigorously proven in some setting or demonstrated experimentally using near-term devices is the subject of active debate. We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality. The proposed quantum algorithm is a suitable candidate for near-future experimental realizations, as it requires only constant-depth quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor gates on a two-dimensional grid of qubits (quantum bits).},

The entanglement-assisted quantum codes we describe do not require the dual-containing constraint necessary for standard quantum error-correcting codes, thus allowing us to "quantize" all of classical linear coding theory. In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity). For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement enables quantum communication.

                  classical position-based cryptography (Defined in
                  this paper as, "The goal of position-based
                  cryptography is to use the geographical position of
                  a party as its only 'credential'.") is impossible, but
                  the quantum version was an open question.  That is,
                  a group of colluders can fool a classical position
                  verification scheme, but could a group of quantum
                  colluders fool a quantum verifier?  Turns out, the
                  answer is "yes" if the colluders have access to
                  pre-prepared entanglement, and so, sadly, even
                  quantum position-based crypto appears not to be

The method is based on excitation of centers with a single photon via a half divider with subsequent coherent inversion of the spin of the excited center by a microwave pulse and on the detection of a photon that was emitted by the excited center and that passed through the divider. We consider the general case in which the transition frequencies of the centers are shifted with respect to each other and the control pulses are detuned with respect to these transitions. We find the probability of creating an entangled state and its fidelity in relation to the parameters of the method and transition frequencies of the centers. Optimal values of these parameters are determined.},

This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing ‘Storage Clouds’ for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing \{IT\} paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision. "

  abstract={Given a suitably large and well connected (complex) graph
                  state, any quantum algorithm can be implemented
                  purely through local measurements on the individual
                  qubits. Measurements can also be used to create the
                  graph state: path erasure techniques allow one to
                  entangle multiple qubits by determining only global
                  properties of the qubits. Here, this powerful
                  approach is extended by demonstrating that even
                  imperfect path erasure can produce the required
                  graph states with high efficiency. By characterizing
                  the degree of error in each path erasure attempt,
                  one can subsume the resulting imperfect entanglement
                  into an extended graph state formalism. The
                  subsequent growth of the improper graph state can be
                  guided, through a series of strategic decisions, in
                  such a way as to bound the growth of the error and
                  eventually yield a high-fidelity graph state. As an
                  implementation of these techniques, we develop an
                  analytic model for atom (or atom-like) qubits in
                  mismatched cavities, under the double-heralding
                  entanglement procedure of Barrett and Kok (2005
                  Phys. Rev. A 71 060310). Compared to straightforward
                  post-selection techniques our protocol offers a
                  dramatic improvement in growing complex
                  high-fidelity graph states.},

abstract = {High-dimensional entanglement has demonstrated its potential for increasing channel capacity and resistance to noise in quantum information processing. However, distributing it is a challenging task, imposing severe restrictions on its application. Here we report the first distribution of three-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement via a 1-km-long few-mode optical fiber. Using an actively stabilizing phase precompensation technique, we successfully transport one photon of a three-dimensional OAM entangled photon pair through the fiber. The distributed OAM entangled state still shows a fidelity up to 71\% with respect to the three-dimensional maximally entangled state (MES). In addition, we certify that the high-dimensional quantum entanglement survives the transportation by violating a generalized Bell inequality, obtaining a violation of \$ \{\textblackslash\}sim 3 \$$\sim$3 standard deviations from the classical limit with \$ \{I_3\} $=$ 2.12 \{\textblackslash\}pm 0.04 \$I3$=$2.12{\textpm}0.04. The method we developed can be extended to a higher OAM dimension and larger distances in principle. Our results make a significant step towards future OAM-based high-dimensional long-distance quantum communication.},

abstract ={Linear optics underpins fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. We demonstrate a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons, and their measurement with a 12-single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with an average fidelity of 0.999 ± 0.001. Our system can be rapidly reprogrammed to implement these and any other linear optical protocol, pointing the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.},

  abstract={Coin flipping is a fundamental cryptographic primitive
                  that enables two distrustful and far apart parties
                  to create a uniformly random bit [Blu81]. Quantum
                  information allows for protocols in the information
                  theoretic setting where no dishonest party can
                  perfectly cheat. The previously best-known quantum
                  protocol by Ambainis achieved a cheating probability
                  of at most 3/4 [Amb01]. On the other hand, Kitaev
                  showed that no quantum protocol can have cheating
                  probability less than 1/(sqrt(2)) [Kit03]. Closing
                  this gap has been one of the important open
                  questions in quantum cryptography. In this paper, we
                  resolve this question by presenting a quantum strong
                  coin flipping protocol with cheating probability
                  arbitrarily close to 1/√2. More precisely, we show
                  how to use any weak coin flipping protocol with
                  cheating probability 1/2 + epsilon in order to
                  achieve a strong coin flipping protocol 
                  with cheating probability 1/sqrt(2) +
                  O(epsilon). The optimal quantum strong coin flipping
                  protocol follows from our construction and the
                  optimal quantum weak coin flipping protocol
                  described by Mochon [Moc07].},

abstract = {Applying quantum processors to model a high-dimensional function approximator is a typical method in quantum machine learning with potential advantage. It is conjectured that the unitarity of quantum circuits provides possible regularization to avoid overfitting. However, it is not clear how the regularization interplays with the expressibility under the limitation of current Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum devices. In this article, we perform simulations and theoretical analysis of the quantum circuit learning problem with hardware-efficient ansatz. Thorough numerical simulations show that the expressibility and generalization error scaling of the ansatz saturate when the circuit depth increases, implying the automatic regularization to avoid the overfitting issue in the quantum circuit learning scenario. This observation is supported by the theory on PAC learnability, which proves that VC dimension is upper bounded due to the locality and unitarity of the hardware-efficient ansatz. Our study provides supporting evidence for automatic regularization by unitarity to suppress overfitting and guidelines for possible performance improvement under hardware constraints.},

A successful platform requires the interaction of many qubits in close proximity, as well as the ability to address each qubit individually, and, to date, such requirements have run counter to each other. Chen et al. devised an optical frequency-domain method with which they were able to simultaneously address many individual rare-earth ion defects (six at this point) with separations all within the diffraction limit of the control light. Because the approach is scalable to tens or hundreds of defects, it provides the prospect of realizing truly large-scale quantum processors.Science, this issue p. 592Solid-state spin defects are a promising platform for quantum science and technology. The realization of larger-scale quantum systems with solid-state defects will require high-fidelity control over multiple defects with nanoscale separations, with strong spin-spin interactions for multi-qubit logic operations and the creation of entangled states. We demonstrate an optical frequency-domain multiplexing technique, allowing high-fidelity initialization and single-shot spin measurement of six rare-earth (Er3+) ions, within the subwavelength volume of a single, silicon photonic crystal cavity. We also demonstrate subwavelength control over coherent spin rotations by using an optical AC Stark shift. Our approach may be scaled to large numbers of ions with arbitrarily small separation and is a step toward realizing strongly interacting atomic defect ensembles with applications to quantum information processing and fundamental studies of many-body dynamics.},

abstract = {Modern data centers increasingly rely on interconnects for delivering critical communications connectivity among numerous servers, memory, and computation resources. Data center interconnects turned to optical communications almost a decade ago, and the recent acceleration in data center requirements is expected to further drive photonic interconnect technologies deeper into the systems architecture. This review paper analyzes optical technologies that will enable next-generation data center optical interconnects. Recent progress addressing the challenges of terabit/s links and networks at the laser, modulator, photodiode, and switch levels is reported and summarized.},

	abstract = {Near-term quantum computers will have limited numbers of qubits and will only be able to reliably perform limited numbers of gates. Therefore, it is crucial to identify applications of quantum processors that use the fewest possible resources. We argue that simulating the time evolution of spin systems is a classically hard problem of practical interest that is among the easiest to address with early quantum devices. We develop optimized implementations and perform detailed resource analyses for several leading quantum algorithms for this problem. By evaluating the best approaches to small-scale quantum simulation, we provide a detailed blueprint for what could be an early practical application of quantum computers.With quantum computers of significant size now on the horizon, we should understand how to best exploit their initially limited abilities. To this end, we aim to identify a practical problem that is beyond the reach of current classical computers, but that requires the fewest resources for a quantum computer. We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, using diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice. Our circuits are orders of magnitude smaller than those for the simplest classically infeasible instances of factoring and quantum chemistry, bringing practical quantum computation closer to reality.},

abstract = {We demonstrated entanglement distribution between two remote quantum nodes located 3 meters apart. This distribution involves the asynchronous preparation of two pairs of atomic memories and the coherent mapping of stored atomic states into light fields in an effective state of near-maximum polarization entanglement. Entanglement is verified by way of the measured violation of a Bell inequality, and it can be used for communication protocols such as quantum cryptography. The demonstrated quantum nodes and channels can be used as segments of a quantum repeater, providing an essential tool for robust long-distance quantum communication.

From the mathematical perspective bipartite EWs provide highly non-trivial generalization of positive operators and establish elegant correspondence with the theory of positive maps in matrix algebras. We concentrate on theoretical analysis of various important notions like decomposability, atomicity, optimality, extremality and exposedness. Several methods of construction are provided as well. Our discussion is illustrated by many examples enabling the reader to see the intricate structure of these objects. It is shown that the theory of EWs finds elegant geometric formulation in terms of convex cones and related geometric structures.}

However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network{\textemdash}who hires whose graduates as faculty{\textemdash}we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News \&amp; World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.},

                  probabilities in asymmetric cable networks (hybrid
                  fiber coaxial nets, or HFCs).
                  Generally good, detailed look at how the window,
                  socket buffer size, delayed ACK and fast retransmit
                  mechanism interact.  Shows how packet loss
                  probabilities affect different size transfers --
                  short ones have higher variance in throughput and
                  generally do better than long ones, having a lower
                  probability of any losses.  Not sure I believe his
                  description of HTTP server behavior; says that HTTP
                  header response is usually sent in a separate pkt
                  from the first data, and that you don't get two full
                  data segments to the client, meaning the client will
                  wait 200 msec before ACKing (delayed ACK), and that
                  the client might be unable to handle the response
                  and data in the same pkt (false, since TCP sockets
                  don't give you msg boundaries to the app).  I
                  suspect  the problem is actually that the server
                  isn't sending two full MTUs for some other reason.
                  Points out that recognition of 3 dupACKs necessary
                  for fast retransmit can't be done if the window is
                  less than 4 pkts, so recommends "superfast"
                  retransmit on the first dupACK, since in these nets
                  ordering is guaranteed, so that's a reliable
                  indicator of loss.  Recommends shortening round trip
                  timer to 200 msec, finer granularity gives better
                  behavior.  Recommends shorter MSS under high loss
                  conditions, asserting that more pkts is better
                  because it gets you more ACKs, making the flow
                  control more robust.  I think this actually probably
                  depends on the characteristics of the errors, since
                  if the packet train loss probability goes up, I
                  think your trouble worsens.  Some editing slipups
                  ("b" as byte rather than bit, "higher" granularity
                  referring to a finer timer).},

comment = {Another MPP file system. Supports various data layouts and
dynamic logical re-partitioning of files. Includes checkpointing and
copy-on-write from the checkpoint. Splits the metadata check part of
an open to what they call the ``attach'' system call, rather than
doing it on every open, reducing overhead. Independent partitions
within a file have independent offsets and EOF markers. Logical
structure of a file can only change on copy. Logical structure is lost
when the file is exported. Currently implemented on top of standard
Unix-like FS.}}

abstract = {The Quantum Internet, by enabling quantum communications among remote quantum nodes, is a network capable of supporting functionalities with no direct counterpart in the classical world. Indeed, with the network and communications functionalities provided by the Quantum Internet, remote quantum devices can communicate and cooperate for solving challenging computational tasks by adopting a distributed computing approach. The aim of this study is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising in the design of a distributed quantum computing ecosystem. For this, the authors provide a survey, following a bottom-up approach, from a communications engineering perspective. They start by introducing the Quantum Internet as the fundamental underlying infrastructure of the distributed quantum computing ecosystem. Then they go further, by elaborating on a high-level system abstraction of the distributed quantum computing ecosystem. They describe such an abstraction through a set of logical layers. Thereby, they clarify dependencies among the aforementioned layers and, at the same time, a road-map emerges.},

abstract = {We present an experimental demonstration of the Hamiltonian manipulation in light-atom interface in Raman-type warm rubidium-87 vapor atomic memory. By adjusting the detuning of the driving beam we varied the relative contributions of the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering to the process of four-wave mixing which reads out a spatially multimode state of atomic memory. We measured the temporal evolution of the readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations between write-in and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an intensified camera. The correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions. Our experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple, plane-wave theoretical model we provide. They allow for a simple interpretation of the coaction of the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering at the readout stage. The Stokes contribution yields additional, adjustable gain at the readout stage, albeit with inevitable extra noise. Here we provide a simple and useful framework to trace it and the results can be utilized in the existing atomic memories setups. Furthermore, the shown Hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of atom-light interfaces readily applicable in current and future quantum protocols with atomic ensembles.},

architecture with builtin language and garbage collection support.
The most original feature is floating point addresses,
designed to address the small object/large object dichotomy. The
exponent indicates the break point in the mantissa between the segment
number and offset. Using the segment number as the object identifier,
this allows a large number of small objects or a few large objects.
Don't know what happens to objects that contain other objects --
illegal? By reference only? I don't think this got past the thought
experiment stage, but I could be wrong.}}

The scale of these systems, their "open nature," and the lack of centralized control pose difficult performance and security challenges.  Much research has recently focused on tackling some of these challenges;  in this paper, we propose future directions for research in P2P systems, and highlight problems that have not yet been studied in great depth.  We focus on two particular aspects of P2P systems -- search and security -- and suggest several open and important research problems for the community to address. }

  abstract={Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspects of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.}

abstract ={The performance of superconducting qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude in the past decade. These circuits benefit from the robustness of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, and at present they have not encountered any hard physical limits. However, building an error-corrected information processor with many such qubits will require solving specific architecture problems that constitute a new field of research. For the first time, physicists will have to master quantum error correction to design and operate complex active systems that are dissipative in nature, yet remain coherent indefinitely. We offer a view on some directions for the field and speculate on its future.},

discuss in detail the architecture of the Bridge Server, but it sounds
like a centralized file controller, an architecture that has now been
discredited for I/O intensive parallel applications. Data is simply
round-robin distributed. They claim this is adequate, but I have my
doubts. Can write what they call ``bridge tools'' which allow sorts,
copies, encyption, etc. to be colocated with the data. I have a
feeling it's not quite as flexible and useful as they wish it would
be. Interesting discussion of external parallel sorting.}}

  abstract={In this short review, I draw attention to new developments in the theory of fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete direction to future work in the development of superconducting qubit systems. The basics of quantum error-correction codes, which I will briefly review, have not significantly changed since their introduction 15 years ago. But an interesting picture has emerged of an efficient use of these codes that may put fault-tolerant operation within reach. It is now understood that two-dimensional surface codes, close relatives of the original toric code of Kitaev, can be adapted as shown by Raussendorf and Harrington to effectively perform logical gate operations in a very simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation simulated to be 0.75\%. This architecture uses topological ideas in its functioning, but it is not 'topological quantum computation' -- there are no non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.}

                  popular, challenging, and important. For modeling
                  approaches that focus on robustness and fragility as
                  unifying concepts, the Internet is an especially
                  attractive case study, mainly because its
                  applications are ubiquitous and pervasive, and
                  widely available expositions exist at every level of
                  detail. Nevertheless, alternative approaches to
                  modeling the Internet often make extremely different
                  assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about
                  fundamental properties of one and the same

                  Internet technology combined with a unique ability

large requests from client programs linked with the UltraNet
networking library, transfers directly from the XBUS buffers to the
UltraNet, without going through the host Sun's memory, which is a big
NFS performance bottleneck. The file system layout is basically Sprite
LFS, but the garbage collector isn't implemented yet, and I'll bet
it's going to have a BIG impact on performance when the system is
running close to full. Lots of details aren't clear to me about the
exact request flow -- obviously the host is involved in some parts.
While this is largely targetted at high-bandwidth applications, a
little more detail on the small-I/O performance would have been nice.
They mention plans to use it in a video server, which seems wrong --
video servers should have a high read/write ratio, which should be
wrong for LFS. Overall the stronger integration of data layout on the
RAID with the file system and NFS server code should be a win.}}

		  reducing the turbochannel overhead (this is tested
		  in old R3000-based Decstations and 175 MHz Alphas).
		  DMA is physically addressed -- the don't use virtual 
		  or scatter/gather even when it's available (updating 
		  the map for each msg is too much, they think; they
		  refer to virtual DMA and scatter/gather as the same
		  thing).  These are on Mach; something like 75 usec
		  to process an interrupt is clearly too much.  As
		  long as they don't cross a page boundary and
		  continue to have incoming cells from the same PDU to 
		  process, they don't interrupt the processor, so they 
		  keep it well below one interrupt per ATM cell.  The
		  88-byte DMAs (two AAL5 payloads) are small enough
		  that it's still a problem.  Dealing with the odd
		  cell and page boundaries significantly complicated
		  things; the original hardware goal was to support
		  only one size of DMA operation.  Good detail on the
		  effect of receiving DMA on the cache; older CPUs
		  required one cycle to invalidate each WORD of the
		  cache!  When using programmed I/O, it's possible to
		  delay the actual move until just before it's needed
		  by the application and get the data to still be in
		  the cache, but it's tricky and requires lots of
		  buffer space.  So, instead, they just lazily
		  invalidate the buffer, and the lag time between DMA
		  and actual buffer access by the CPU appears to be
		  long enough that the cache winds up okay.  Talks a
		  little about fbufs and application direct channels (ADCs).
		  Their performance numbers are a little unclear to
		  me, in that I don't understand if it's really
		  app-to-app (something about linking them into the
		  kernel), and they measured sender and receiver in
		  isolation but not hooked up to each other.  500 Mbps 
		  receive with an Alpha, 325 transmit (limited by the
		  turbochannel).  Asserts that the DMA/PIO choice is
		  very system-dependent.  Good references.},

The processor is modeled and simulated using VHDL. It consists of a \{MIPS\} \{R2000\} processor with a quantum processing module embedded within it. Additionally, an assembler has been developed capable of interpreting assembly programs modeling quantum algorithms or circuits, containing instructions from both the standard \{MIPS\} instruction set as well as the Quantum Assembly (QASM) instruction set. Furthermore, a quantum C++ library has been developed, with methods and classes to encapsulate the \{QASM\} instructions so that a programmer may use it to develop a C++ program implementing a quantum algorithm containing both classical and quantum parts.

    abstract = { Quantum computers can exploit a Hilbert space whose dimension increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In experiment, quantum supremacy has recently been achieved by the Google team by using a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device with over 50 qubits. However, the question of what can be implemented on NISQ devices is still not fully explored, and discovering useful tasks for such devices is a topic of considerable interest. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are regarded as well-suited for execution on NISQ devices by combining quantum computers with classical computers, and are expected to be the first useful applications for quantum computing. Meanwhile, mitigation of errors on quantum processors is also crucial to obtain reliable results. In this article, we review the basic results for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and quantum error mitigation techniques. Since quantum computing with NISQ devices is an actively developing field, we expect this review to be a useful basis for future studies. }

By exploiting the optical properties of metamaterials, these nanoparticles may play the role of "lumped" nanocircuit elements such as nanoinductors, nanocapacitors, and nanoresistors, analogous to microelectronics. I show that this concept of metamaterial-inspired nanoelectronics ("metactronics") can bring the tools and mathematical machinery of the circuit theory into optics, may link the fields of optics, electronics, plasmonics, and metamaterials, and may provide road maps to future innovations in nanoscale optical devices, components, and more intricate nanoscale metamaterials.

  abstract={Society relies and depends increasingly on information exchange and communication. In the quantum world, security and privacy is a built-in feature for information processing. The essential ingredient for exploiting these quantum advantages is the resource of entanglement, which can be shared between two or more parties. The distribution of entanglement over large distances constitutes a key challenge for current research and development. Due to losses of the transmitted quantum particles, which typically scale exponentially with the distance, intermediate quantum repeater stations are needed. Here we show how to generalise the quantum repeater concept to the multipartite case, by describing large-scale quantum networks, i.e. network nodes and their long-distance links, consistently in the language of graphs and graph states. This unifying approach comprises both the distribution of multipartite entanglement across the network, and the protection against errors via encoding. The correspondence to graph states also provides a tool for optimising the architecture of quantum networks.}

Different existing projects are compared, based on the tools used and security aspects being examined. Since many systems require both hardware and software components to work together to provide the system’s promised security protections, it is not sufficient to verify just the software levels or just the hardware levels in a mutually exclusive fashion. This survey especially highlights system levels that are verified by the different existing projects and presents to the readers the state of the art in hardware and software system security verification. Few approaches come close to providing full-system verification, and there is still much room for&nbsp;improvement.},

ABSTRACT={We present an overview of the key ideas and skills necessary to begin implementing tensor network methods numerically, which is intended to facilitate the practical application of tensor network methods for researchers that are already versed with their theoretical foundations. These skills include an introduction to the contraction of tensor networks, to optimal tensor decompositions, and to the manipulation of gauge degrees of freedom in tensor networks. The topics presented are of key importance to many common tensor network algorithms such as DMRG, TEBD, TRG, PEPS, and MERA.},

                  Tons of data, though they didn't keep exact records
                  on each read/write, and they didn't keep stat.
                  Since their work shows that most files are open only
                  for very short periods of time, they felt like that
                  justified their conclusions on read/write rate, but
                  I'm not so sure.  They did record the amount of data
                  read and written, just not the operation timestamps
                  and arguments.  Median size of files opened (as
                  opposed to simply existing in the FS) was 710
                  bytes.  Most of the data read, though, comes from
                  files larger than 20K.  68pct of files opened for
                  read are completely read, and 78pct of files opened
                  for write are completely written.  Half of all the
                  execute requests go to 13 executables.  They split
                  up the ops according to whether they were user,
                  system or net (e.g. UUCP and USENET) accessed.
                  84pct of the bytes moved were in reads.  20pct of
                  them were reads of /etc/passwd!  Useful data on how

about 14 percent of the movies account for half of the requests. They

In this environment they expect to be able to support 380 simultaneous
1.5 Mbps streams on 24 Ruemmler-like disks with under 0.5 jitters per
hour per user. Without the mirroring of the high-demand material, it's
closer to 300. I'm not convinced their simulations are thorough enough
yet to rely on their numbers. This is for their Tiger Shark video
server. Discusses striping across less than the total number of disks,
which among other things reduces the vulnerability of the system to
disk failures. Recommends block size of 256KB.},

However, next-generation photonic quantum technologies require higher generation probabilities of photons in well-controlled pure states capable of high-visibility interference. We have harnessed bespoke fiber technology to develop virtually alignment-free sources that deliver high-purity heralded single photons in telecoms single-mode fiber. The resulting access to low-loss optical delay enabled us to actively route the heralded output from two almost identical sources to enhance the delivery probability of single photons relative to one individual source. Our results indicate how the scale of photonic quantum technologies might be increased via guided-wave multiplexing of high-purity photons.},

To date, the largest nonlinearities have been realized with single atoms and atomic ensembles. We show that a single quantum dot coupled to a photonic crystal nanocavity can facilitate controlled phase and amplitude modulation between two modes of light at the single-photon level. At larger control powers, we observed phase shifts up to π/4 and amplitude modulation up to 50%. This was accomplished by varying the photon number in the control beam at a wavelength that was the same as that of the signal, or at a wavelength that was detuned by several quantum dot linewidths from the signal. Our results present a step toward quantum logic devices and quantum nondemolition measurements on a chip.},

		  different physical location.  Those locations are
		  maintained with a multi-level set of indirect

		  that you can step back in through time, too,
		  increasing the apparent size of the disk to make old

We prove that there is a direct relation between the dimension of a qudit stabilizer code and the size of its corresponding stabilizer, and this implies that the code and its stabilizer are dual to each other. We also show that any qudit stabilizer can be put in a canonical, or standard, form using a series of Clifford gates, and we provide an explicit efficient algorithm for doing this. Our work generalizes known results that were valid only for prime dimensional systems and may be useful in constructing efficient encoding/decoding quantum circuits for qudit stabilizer codes and better qudit quantum error correcting codes.

Such networks can economically partition the resources of large modular systems into a wide variety of subsystems. Any possible partition can be realized by paralleling several networks or by multiplexing a single network in a manner to be described later. Results will be given indicating that a cost/performance advantage over the crossbar can be obtained for large systems and that the crossbar can, in fact, be considered a non-optimal special case of a banyan network. Inherent fail-soft capability and the existence of rapid control algorithms which can be largely performed by distributed logic within the network are also important attributes of banyans.This paper presents fundamental properties and preliminary simulation results of banyan partitioning networks.

  abstract={One of the most sought-after goals in experimental quantum communication is the implementation of a quantum repeater. The performance of quantum repeaters can be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private capacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way communication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the search for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these capacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels allow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding capacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark the implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to model communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to the realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on the input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is convex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical capacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed entanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the d -dimensional erasure channel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli channels. In particular, our bound improves on the previous best known squashed entanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel.}

The key is authenticated by illuminating it with a light pulse containing fewer photons than spatial degrees of freedom and verifying the spatial shape of the reflected light. Quantum-physical principles forbid an attacker to fully characterize the incident light pulse. Therefore, he cannot emulate the key by digitally constructing the expected optical response, even if all information about the key is publicly known. QSA uses a key that cannot be copied due to technological limitations and is quantum-secure against digital emulation. Moreover, QSA does not depend on secrecy of stored data, does not depend on unproven mathematical assumptions, and is straightforward to implement with current technology.},

Previous approaches were either too computationally intensive or tailored to handle special cases such as single qubits or pure states. By contrast, our approach combines the efficiency of online optimization with generally applicable and well-motivated data-processing techniques. We numerically demonstrate these advantages in several scenarios including mixed states, higher-dimensional systems, and restricted measurements.}

The first experiment shows a strong anticorrelation between the triggered detections on both sides of a beam splitter. This result is in contradiction with any classical wave model of light, but in agreement with a quantum description involving single-photon states. The same source and detection scheme were used in a second experiment, where we have observed interferences with a visibility over 98\%.}

We show here that dephasing can be overcome by using a periodic train of light pulses to synchronize the phases of the precessing spins, and we demonstrate this effect in an ensemble of singly charged (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots. This mode locking leads to constructive interference of contributions to Faraday rotation and presents potential applications based on robust quantum coherence within an ensemble of dots.

An important application of this work is to the ``cold boot'' attacks of Halderman et al. We make new observations about the structure of RSA keys that allow our algorithm to make use of the redundant information in the typical storage format of an RSA private key. Our algorithm itself is elementary and does not make use of the lattice techniques used in other RSA key reconstruction problems. We give an analysis of the running time behavior of our algorithm that matches the threshold phenomenon observed in our experiments.",

  abstract={One of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a classical efficient simulation is not available. Important cases are situations in which one cannot classically calculate local expectation values of state preparations efficiently. In this work, we develop weak-membership formulations of the certification of ground state preparations. We provide a non-interactive protocol for certifying ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. This certification protocol can be applied to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: For example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can encode universal quantum computation in such ground states. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to ground state encodings of IQP circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum supremacy. These can be certified efficiently when the error is polynomially bounded.}

abstract = {Phase coherence is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. Understanding the loss of coherence is paramount for future quantum information processing. We studied the coherent dynamics of a single central spin (a nitrogen-vacancy center) coupled to a bath of spins (nitrogen impurities) in diamond. Our experiments show that both the internal interactions of the bath and the coupling between the central spin and the bath can be tuned in situ, allowing access to regimes with surprisingly different behavior. The observed dynamics are well explained by analytics and numerical simulations, leading to valuable insight into the loss of coherence in spin systems. These measurements demonstrate that spins in diamond provide an excellent test bed for models and protocols in quantum information.

are never overwritten, they're cleaned and reused. Since
stripes at the storage servers are done log-style, security is
maintained because, although arbitrary clients can write arbitrary
stripes, it won't "take" for other clients until the file manager
updates the metadata. Since logs are striped, rather than individual
files, they win on small file writes. Some wierdness with the log file
system actually containing some of its own metadata in a file that I
didn't quite follow. Clients tend to go CPU-bound on data copy and
parity calculation. Sprite-like semantics with open files, rather than
NFS-like stateless.}}

  abstract={An ( n ,1, p )-quantum random access (QRA) coding, introduced by Ambainis et al (1999 ACM Symp. Theory of Computing p 376), is the following communication system: the sender which has n -bit information encodes his/her information into one qubit, which is sent to the receiver. The receiver can recover any one bit of the original n bits correctly with probability at least p , through a certain decoding process based on positive operator-valued measures. Actually, Ambainis et al shows the existence of a (2,1,0.85)-QRA coding and also proves the impossibility of its classical counterpart. Chuang immediately extends it to a (3,1,0.79)-QRA coding and whether or not a (4,1, p )-QRA coding such that p > 1/2 exists has been open since then. This paper gives a negative answer to this open question. Moreover, we generalize its negative answer for one-qubit encoding to the case of multiple-qubit encoding}

  abstract = {Quantum programming languages are essential to translate ideas into instructions that can be executed by a quantum computer. Not only are they crucial to the programming of quantum computers at scale but also they can facilitate the discovery and development of quantum algorithms even before hardware exists that is capable of executing them. Quantum programming languages are used for controlling existing physical devices, for estimating the execution costs of quantum algorithms on future devices, for teaching quantum computing concepts, or for verifying quantum algorithms and their implementations. They are used by newcomers and seasoned practitioners, researchers and developers working on the next ground-breaking discovery or applying known concepts to real-world problems. This variety in purpose and target audiences is reflected in the design and ecosystem of the existing quantum programming languages, depending on which factors a language prioritizes. In this Review, we highlight important aspects of quantum programming and how it differs from conventional programming. We overview a selection of several state-of-the-art quantum programming languages, highlight their salient features, and provide code samples for each of the languages and Docker files to facilitate installation of the software packages.},

Strong evidence for superiority of quantum annealing has come from comparing quantum annealing implemented through quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to classical annealing. Motivated by recent experiments we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Even though, for two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, a better scaling is seen for quantum annealing, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements which are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care has to be taken when using QMC simulations to assess potential for quantum speedup.},

abstract ={As a direct consequence of the no-cloning theorem, the deterministic amplification as in classical communication is impossible for unknown quantum states. This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network, e.g., for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an entangled state, i.e., entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 SDs beyond the classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Because our results already allow for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our research to lay the ground for a fully fledged quantum repeater over a realistic high-loss and even turbulent quantum channel.},

	abstract = {The exceptionally long quantum coherence times of phosphorus donor nuclear spin qubits in silicon, coupled with the proven scalability of silicon-based nano-electronics, make them attractive candidates for large-scale quantum computing. However, the high threshold of topological quantum error correction can only be captured in a two-dimensional array of qubits operating synchronously and in parallel{\textemdash}posing formidable fabrication and control challenges. We present an architecture that addresses these problems through a novel shared-control paradigm that is particularly suited to the natural uniformity of the phosphorus donor nuclear spin qubit states and electronic confinement. The architecture comprises a two-dimensional lattice of donor qubits sandwiched between two vertically separated control layers forming a mutually perpendicular crisscross gate array. Shared-control lines facilitate loading/unloading of single electrons to specific donors, thereby activating multiple qubits in parallel across the array on which the required operations for surface code quantum error correction are carried out by global spin control. The complexities of independent qubit control, wave function engineering, and ad hoc quantum interconnects are explicitly avoided. With many of the basic elements of fabrication and control based on demonstrated techniques and with simulated quantum operation below the surface code error threshold, the architecture represents a new pathway for large-scale quantum information processing in silicon and potentially in other qubit systems where uniformity can be exploited.},

Timekeeping precision at 1 part in 10^18 enables new timing applications in relativistic geodesy, enhanced Earth- and space-based navigation and telescopy, and new tests of physics beyond the standard model. Here, we describe the development and operation of two optical lattice clocks, both using spin-polarized, ultracold atomic ytterbium. A measurement comparing these systems demonstrates an unprecedented atomic clock instability of 1.6 × 10–18 after only 7 hours of averaging.},

		  It's actually a lot like a regular FFS layout, but
		  with some minor tweaks.
		  Like Episode (and VMS F11ODS2), the freemap and the
		  inodes are stored in something resembling regular
		  files.  Checkpoints called snapshots are created by
		  copying the root inode and making everything else
		  copy on write.  Their blockmap is comples,
		  indicating when an inode is in use with a bit flag
		  for each snapshot.  Updating this sounds expensive
		  to me, but they claim their snapshotting is much
		  cheaper than Episode's file set clones because all
		  the inodes don't have to be copied.  Several daily
		  snapshots are user visible, but they are also used
		  internally as FS checkpoints every few seconds in
		  order to simplify crash recovery.  Uncheckpointed
		  writes are stored in battery-backed NVRAM.  System
		  restart is supposed to be very fast.  Also uses RAID 
		  disk layout with effective writes across all stripes 
		  to keep parity update costs low and performance
		  high.  Claims 3K ops/sec. with 18 msec response

                  Hadamards.  Uses constant-depth rotation by Hamming
                  weight, which requires constant-depth fanout.
                  Thm. 5 says add/mul/div/sort are in B-QNC^0_f.
                  Proof is very short, just cites Siu and says it's
                  easy to prove weighted threshold gate is in
                  B-QNC^0_f.
                  Okay, I think I understand this: B-QNC^0_f is
                  bounded-error, bounded-fanin, unbounded-fanout,
                  quantum Nick's class.  They show how a bounded-error
                  threshold gate can be created using the counting
                  gate, which requires approx QFT (I'll bet this hurts

                  inverted using the fanout/fanin inversion technique,
                  then the inverse QFT.  Claim is that error is
                  one-sided, false-negative w/ Prob(1/n).  (How we got
                  from one-sided to two-sided error, I'm not sure.)
                  Also claims that exact threshold gate can be done in
                  O(log* n) time, which I probably do believe.
                  Paper ends w/ assertion that factoring is in

An internal conversion efficiency of the converter is estimated to be 0.44 at the maximum which is achieved by a pump power of 0.43 W, whereas a rate of internal background photons caused by the strong cw pump laser is estimated to be 9 kHz/mW within a bandwidth of about 1 nm. By using the experimental values related to the intrinsic property of the converter, and using the intensity correlation and the average photon number of a 637 nm input light pulse, we derive the intensity correlation of a converted telecom light pulse. Then we discuss feasibility of a single-photon frequency conversion to the telecommunication band for a long-distance quantum communication based on NV centers in diamond.},

Many such problems defined as computationally difficult can be mathematically mapped onto the so-called Ising problem, which looks at finding the minimum energy configuration for an array of coupled spins. Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems. Such a scalable architecture could help to optimize solutions to a wide range of complex problems.Science, this issue pp. 603 and 614The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.},

  abstract={In order to communicate information in a quantum network effectively, all network nodes should share a common reference frame. Here, we propose to study how well m nodes in a quantum network can establish a common spatial reference frame from scratch, even though t of them may be arbitrarily faulty. We present a protocol that allows all correctly functioning nodes to agree on a common reference frame as long as they are fully connected and not more than ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/16/6/063040/njp495144ieqn1.gif] {$t<m/3$} nodes are faulty. Our protocol furthermore has the appealing property that it allows any existing two-node protocol for reference frame agreement to be lifted to a protocol for a quantum network.}

abstract ={Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

Drawing upon mature compiler technologies, we discuss similarities and differences between compilation of classical and quantum programs, and adapt our methods to optimizing the compilation time and output for the quantum case. Our work also integrates a reversible-logic synthesis tool in the compiler to facilitate coding of quantum circuits. Lastly, we present some useful quantum program analysis scenarios and discuss their implications, specifically with an elaborate discussion of timing analysis for critical path estimation. Our work focuses on bridging the gap between high-level quantum algorithm specifications and low-level physical implementations, while providing good scalability to larger and more interesting problems."

	abstract = {Photonic systems based on energy-time entanglement have been proposed to test local realism using the Bell inequality. A violation of this inequality normally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. We show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled systems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to compromise the system without leaving a trace. We reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6\% faked detector efficiency using tailored pulses of classical light, which exceeds even the quantum prediction. This is the first demonstration of a violation-faking source that gives both tunable violation and high faked detector efficiency. The implications are severe: the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality cannot be used to show device-independent security for energy-time entanglement setups based on Franson{\textquoteright}s configuration. However, device-independent security can be reestablished, and we conclude by listing a number of improved tests and experimental setups that would protect against all current and future attacks of this type.},

  abstract={We analyze how the performance of a quantum-repeater network depends on the protocol employed to distribute entanglement, and we find that the choice of repeater-to-repeater link protocol has a profound impact on entanglement-distribution rate as a function of hardware parameters. We develop numerical simulations of quantum networks using different protocols, where the repeater hardware is modeled in terms of key performance parameters, such as photon generation rate and collection efficiency. These parameters are motivated by recent experimental demonstrations in quantum dots, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. We find that a quantum-dot repeater with the newest protocol (‘MidpointSource’) delivers the highest entanglement-distribution rate for typical cases where there is low probability of establishing entanglement per transmission, and in some cases the rate is orders of magnitude higher than other schemes. Our simulation tools can be used to evaluate communication protocols as part of designing a large-scale quantum network.}

reads after random writes are slow. Still can't beat SunOS 4.1.3 on
most benchmarks, running as a user process under Minix. Bad news is
heavy RAM usage to hold mapping tables and the current unwritten dirty
segment, and extra copies in the implementation. Contrasts heavily to
the Loge work (done in cooperation with HP, I think) that modifies the
disk controller to present logical blocks whose mapping changes as
convenient to the controller. I'm not convinced their solution is
right, but an important part of the design space to explore.}}

Before illustrating how this can be done, we present the circuit design principle using the satisfiability (SAT) problem as an example. Then, based on this principle, we show the quantum circuits for two different kinds of applications. The first one is searching a phone book. Although this is a typical example of Grover's algorithm, we show that it is impractical as a real-world application. As the second application, we give the quantum circuits for a more practical application-breaking a symmetric cryptosystem. Although these two applications have quite different types of search criteria, they are both one-way functions and the proposed circuits can actually be generalized to any such problems. In this perspective, we conclude this paper by proposing a template of quantum circuits that is capable of searching the solution of a certain class of one-way functions.},

  abstract={We describe an optimized, self-correcting procedure for the Bayesian inference of pure quantum states. By analyzing the history of measurement outcomes at each step, the procedure returns the most likely pure state, as well as the optimal basis for the measurement that is to follow. The latter is chosen to maximize, on average, the fidelity of the most likely state after the measurement. We also consider a practical variant of this protocol, where the available measurement bases are restricted to certain limited sets of bases. We demonstrate the success of our method by considering in detail the single-qubit and two-qubit cases, and comparing the performance of our method against other existing methods.}

		  improving throughput by reducing data-touching
		  costs.  PathIDs are a link-layer header that helps
		  early demultiplexing.  Could be done with IPv6 flow
		  ids, too.  Reduced latency by eliminating some
		  unnecessary processing, and doing some layer
		  integration (violation, I think Ted would say).
		  Dropped latency from 760 usec to 580 usec for a
		  simple 1-byte UDP pkt pingpong.
		  Reasonable analysis of where time goes in existing
		  IP implementation (all his work was done on Alphas
		  either under OSF/1 or Ultrix 4.2a) but a little
		  short on quantifying which parts of his work gave
		  the biggest boosts.
		  Describes three techniques for improving network
		  throughput: CRC redundancy avoidance, DMA
		  Redirection, and Nocopyin.  CRA using routing info
		  to detect when it's on a LAN, and turns off CRCs for 
		  both UDP and TCP.  DMA Redir uses a cluster mbuf,
		  detects via CPU polling when a packet header has
		  arrived, and modifies the pointer the adapter will
		  use to deliver the rest of the pkt.  The first 2048
		  bytes(!) arrive into the mbuf and have to be
		  copied, the rest should land at the correct
		  destination.  Nocopyin avoids the copy to kernel
		  mbufs, letting the data go directly from user
		  buffers to host adapter.  Tries to reduce the amount 
		  of time this will cause the user process to block.
		  Pushed UDP receive to 78Mbps on FDDI, from 58.  The
		  DMA Redir and early demultiplexing seem similar to
		  some of the ideas we've been bandying about.
		  Thesis needed another editing pass, and 65
		  references seems low.  Okay, not spectacular, work.},

abstract="Cryptosystems like AES and triple-DES are designed to encrypt a sequence of input bytes (the plaintext) into a sequence of output bytes (the ciphertext) in such a way that the output carries no information about that plaintext except its length. In recent years, concerns have been raised about ''side-channel'' attacks on various cryptosystems---attacks that make use of some kind of leaked information about the cryptographic operations (e.g., power consumption or timing) to defeat them. In this paper, we describe a somewhat different kind of side-channel provided by data compression algorithms, yielding information about their inputs by the size of their outputs. The existence of some information about a compressor's input in the size of its output is obvious; here, we discuss ways to use this apparently very small leak of information in surprisingly powerful ways.",

server by striping across N NFS servers. Individual files are still
stored at a single NFS server, though. No mention of how to deal with
disk full errors, but has to happen. Uses vectored RPC. Due to file
lookup/create semantics under NFS v2, hashes file name to determine
where to create the file. Makes rename expensive because it copies the
file. Sends all read and lookup requests to all servers, all but one
of which will fail. Very rough paper, and not a great idea, IMHO,
anyway. No performance advantage and very little functionality gain,
plus not measured or implemented well.},

We report the development of Robot Scientist "Adam," which advances the automation of both. Adam has autonomously generated functional genomics hypotheses about the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and experimentally tested these hypotheses by using laboratory automation. We have confirmed Adam's conclusions through manual experiments. To describe Adam's research, we have developed an ontology and logical language. The resulting formalization involves over 10,000 different research units in a nested treelike structure, 10 levels deep, that relates the 6.6 million biomass measurements to their logical description. This formalization describes how a machine contributed to scientific knowledge.

Therefore the distinction between finite and infinite is not as relevant as the distinction between realistic and unrealistic.2) In many cases there are subtle ways to solve very large problems quickly, in spite of the fact that they appear at first to require examination of too many possibilities.3) There are also cases where we can prove that a fairly natural problem is intrinsically hard, far beyond our conceivable capabilities.4) It takes a good deal of skill to decide whether a given problem is in the easy or hard class; but even if a problem does turn out to be hard there are useful and interesting ways to change it into one that can be done satisfactorily.

abstract = {When software developers want to understand the reason for a program's behavior, they must translate their questions about the behavior into a series of questions about code, speculating about the causes in the process. The Whyline is a new kind of debugging tool that avoids such speculation by instead enabling developers to select a question about program output from a set of why did and why didn't questions derived from the program's code and execution. The tool then finds one or more possible explanations for the output in question, using a combination of static and dynamic slicing, precise call graphs, and new algorithms for determining potential sources of values and explanations for why a line of code was not reached. Evaluations of the tool on one task showed that novice programmers with the Whyline were twice as fast as expert programmers without it. The tool has the potential to simplify debugging in many software development contexts.},

It has been known for some time that without additional assumptions it is impossible to achieve this task perfectly in general --- indeed, it is impossible even for the simple butterfly network. As additional resource we allow free classical communication between any pair of network nodes. It is shown that perfect quantum network coding is achievable in this model whenever classical network coding is possible over the same network when replacing all quantum capacities by classical capacities. More precisely, it is proved that perfect quantum network coding using free classical communication is possible over a network with k source-target pairs if there exists a classical linear (or even vector-linear) coding scheme over a finite ring. Our proof is constructive in that we give explicit quantum coding operations for each network node. This paper also gives an upper bound on the number of classical communication required in terms of k, the maximal fan-in of any network node, and the size of the network.",

abstract = {The second quantum revolution brings with it the promise of a quantum internet. As
the first quantum network hardware prototypes near completion new challenges emerge.
A functional network is more than just the physical hardware, yet work on scalable
quantum network systems is in its infancy. In this paper we present a quantum network
protocol designed to enable end-to-end quantum communication in the face of the new
fundamental and technical challenges brought by quantum mechanics. We develop a quantum
data plane protocol that enables end-to-end quantum communication and can serve as
a building block for more complex services. One of the key challenges in near-term
quantum technology is decoherence --- the gradual decay of quantum information ---
which imposes extremely stringent limits on storage times. Our protocol is designed
to be efficient in the face of short quantum memory lifetimes. We demonstrate this
using a simulator for quantum networks and show that the protocol is able to deliver
its service even in the face of significant losses due to decoherence. Finally, we
conclude by showing that the protocol remains functional on the extremely resource
limited hardware that is being developed today underlining the timeliness of this
work.},

reused virtually all of the FS code by simply making the LFS segment
IDs point to device (even tertiary media). Talks about, but hasn't
actually implemented, various migration policies. Performance is
appalling, due mostly to extra copies. Data is really only read from
disk, it has to be copied to the cache disk first. I suspect they also
have low-level SCSI bus contention, etc.}}

                  fair-first/fast-first.  Bullet splits objects and
                  sends disjoint info to each receiver, rather than
                  all getting the same thing, which improves chances
                  that the downstream receivers can find a copy of the
                  data chunk they missed.  Nodes have both a parent,
                  and peers, and can retrieve missed chunks from the
                  peers to increase apparent BW from the parent.
                  Implemented using MACEDON, tested primarily on
                  ModelNet, but also on 1000-node PlanetLab.  Absolute
                  performance numbers remain a little low,

  are bottlenecked by their file I/O needs. Even if the multiprocessor is
  configured with sufficient I/O hardware, the file-system software often fails
  to provide the available bandwidth to the application. Although libraries and
  improved file-system interfaces can make a significant improvement, we
  believe that fundamental changes are needed in the file-server software. We
  propose a new technique, {\em disk-directed I/O}, that flips the usual
  relationship between server and client to allow the disks (actually, disk
  servers) to determine the flow of data for maximum performance. Our
  simulations show that tremendous performance gains are possible. Indeed,
  disk-directed I/O provided consistent high performance that was largely
  independent of data distribution, and close to the maximum disk bandwidth.},

                  recombine into graph states.  They claim that
                  directly purifying is more efficient, which seems
                  natural.  Thaddeus really likes their Eq. 3 as a
                  representation for the density matrix for a graph
                  state.  Refs. 9 and 10, 2005, describe part of their
                  purification purification protocol assumptions.}

                  line across a bridge of spin 0 (Si28 and Si30).
                  10^5 nuclei form a single qubit, if I understand.
                  Readout is done via magnetic resonance force
                  microscopy (MRFM), reading oscillations of the
                  bridge.  Initialization is done via electrons whose
                  spin is set with polarized light (optical pumping).
                  High vacuum and low temperatures (4K) are required.
                  I'm a little unclear on how
                  qubits are addressed, but it's a linear array,
                  and interactions seem to possible beyond nearest
                  neighbors but not very far.  They recommend sticking
                  to nearest neighbors.  Good graph and
                  equations on how many qubits you can build (depends
                  on the quality of polarization you can achieve, as
                  well as impurity levels).  Not sure about gate
                  speed.  Sounds like timing of pulses is important,
                  so latching et al might be important.
                  Decoherence times of 100sec are expected, and
                  gates are implemented with RF pulses from a coil.
                  This is very close to the info I'd like to see as a
                  computer engineer, but I don't follow all of it
                  yet.  This is being implemented at Keio.}

We demonstrate and investigate the digital approach to quantum simulation in a system of trapped ions. With sequences of up to 100 gates and 6 qubits, the full time dynamics of a range of spin systems are digitally simulated. Interactions beyond those naturally present in our simulator are accurately reproduced, and quantitative bounds are provided for the overall simulation quality. Our results demonstrate the key principles of digital quantum simulation and provide evidence that the level of control required for a full-scale device is within reach.},

An increasingly large scientific and industrial community is working toward the realization of such a device. An arbitrarily large quantum computer may best be constructed using a modular approach. We present a blueprint for a trapped ion{\textendash}based scalable quantum computer module, making it possible to create a scalable quantum computer architecture based on long-wavelength radiation quantum gates. The modules control all operations as stand-alone units, are constructed using silicon microfabrication techniques, and are within reach of current technology. To perform the required quantum computations, the modules make use of long-wavelength radiation{\textendash}based quantum gate technology. To scale this microwave quantum computer architecture to a large size, we present a fully scalable design that makes use of ion transport between different modules, thereby allowing arbitrarily many modules to be connected to construct a large-scale device. A high error{\textendash}threshold surface error correction code can be implemented in the proposed architecture to execute fault-tolerant operations. With appropriate adjustments, the proposed modules are also suitable for alternative trapped ion quantum computer architectures, such as schemes using photonic interconnects.},

  abstract={Simple optical instruments are linear optical networks where the incident light modes are turned into equal numbers of outgoing modes by linear transformations. For example, such instruments are beam splitters, multiports, interferometers, fibre couplers, polarizers, gravitational lenses, parametric amplifiers, phase-conjugating mirrors and also black holes. The paper develops the quantum theory of simple optical instruments and applies the theory to a few characteristic situations, to the splitting and interference of photons and to the manifestation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations in parametric downconversion. How to model irreversible devices such as absorbers and amplifiers is also shown. Finally, the paper develops the theory of Hawking radiation for a simple optical black hole. The paper is intended as a primer, as a nearly self-consistent tutorial. The reader should be familiar with basic quantum mechanics and statistics, and perhaps with optics and some elementary field theory. The quantum theory of light in dielectrics serves as the starting point and, in the concluding section, as a guide to understand quantum black holes.}

  abstract={In this paper we present the impact of classical electronics constraints on a solid-state quantum dot logical qubit architecture. Constraints due to routing density, bandwidth allocation, signal timing and thermally aware placement of classical supporting electronics significantly affect the quantum error correction circuit's error rate (by a factor of ~3–4 in our specific analysis). We analyze one level of a quantum error correction circuit using nine data qubits in a Bacon–Shor code configured as a quantum memory. A hypothetical silicon double quantum dot quantum bit (qubit) is used as the fundamental element. A pessimistic estimate of the error probability of the quantum circuit is calculated using the total number of gates and idle time using a provably optimal schedule for the circuit operations obtained with an integer program methodology. The micro-architecture analysis provides insight about the different ways the electronics impact the circuit performance (e.g. extra idle time in the schedule), which can significantly limit the ultimate performance of any quantum circuit and therefore is a critical foundation for any future larger scale architecture analysis.}

	abstract = {The doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 2 years, a seemly inevitable trend that has been called Moore{\textquoteright}s law, has contributed immensely to improvements in computer performance. However, silicon-based transistors cannot get much smaller than they are today, and other approaches should be explored to keep performance growing. Leiserson et al. review recent examples and argue that the most promising place to look is at the top of the computing stack, where improvements in software, algorithms, and hardware architecture can bring the much-needed boost.Science, this issue p. eaam9744BACKGROUNDImprovements in computing power can claim a large share of the credit for many of the things that we take for granted in our modern lives: cellphones that are more powerful than room-sized computers from 25 years ago, internet access for nearly half the world, and drug discoveries enabled by powerful supercomputers. Society has come to rely on computers whose performance increases exponentially over time.Much of the improvement in computer performance comes from decades of miniaturization of computer components, a trend that was foreseen by the Nobel Prize{\textendash}winning physicist Richard Feynman in his 1959 address, {\textquotedblleft}There{\textquoteright}s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,{\textquotedblright} to the American Physical Society. In 1975, Intel founder Gordon Moore predicted the regularity of this miniaturization trend, now called Moore{\textquoteright}s law, which, until recently, doubled the number of transistors on computer chips every 2 years.Unfortunately, semiconductor miniaturization is running out of steam as a viable way to grow computer performance{\textemdash}there isn{\textquoteright}t much more room at the {\textquotedblleft}Bottom.{\textquotedblright} If growth in computing power stalls, practically all industries will face challenges to their productivity. Nevertheless, opportunities for growth in computing performance will still be available, especially at the {\textquotedblleft}Top{\textquotedblright} of the computing-technology stack: software, algorithms, and hardware architecture.ADVANCESSoftware can be made more efficient by performance engineering: restructuring software to make it run faster. Performance engineering can remove inefficiencies in programs, known as software bloat, arising from traditional software-development strategies that aim to minimize an application{\textquoteright}s development time rather than the time it takes to run. Performance engineering can also tailor software to the hardware on which it runs, for example, to take advantage of parallel processors and vector units.Algorithms offer more-efficient ways to solve problems. Indeed, since the late 1970s, the time to solve the maximum-flow problem improved nearly as much from algorithmic advances as from hardware speedups. But progress on a given algorithmic problem occurs unevenly and sporadically and must ultimately face diminishing returns. As such, we see the biggest benefits coming from algorithms for new problem domains (e.g., machine learning) and from developing new theoretical machine models that better reflect emerging hardware.Hardware architectures can be streamlined{\textemdash}for instance, through processor simplification, where a complex processing core is replaced with a simpler core that requires fewer transistors. The freed-up transistor budget can then be redeployed in other ways{\textemdash}for example, by increasing the number of processor cores running in parallel, which can lead to large efficiency gains for problems that can exploit parallelism. Another form of streamlining is domain specialization, where hardware is customized for a particular application domain. This type of specialization jettisons processor functionality that is not needed for the domain. It can also allow more customization to the specific characteristics of the domain, for instance, by decreasing floating-point precision for machine-learning applications.In the post-Moore era, performance improvements from software, algorithms, and hardware architecture will increasingly require concurrent changes across other levels of the stack. These changes will be easier to implement, from engineering-management and economic points of view, if they occur within big system components: reusable software with typically more than a million lines of code or hardware of comparable complexity. When a single organization or company controls a big component, modularity can be more easily reengineered to obtain performance gains. Moreover, costs and benefits can be pooled so that important but costly changes in one part of the big component can be justified by benefits elsewhere in the same component.OUTLOOKAs miniaturization wanes, the silicon-fabrication improvements at the Bottom will no longer provide the predictable, broad-based gains in computer performance that society has enjoyed for more than 50 years. Software performance engineering, development of algorithms, and hardware streamlining at the Top can continue to make computer applications faster in the post-Moore era. Unlike the historical gains at the Bottom, however, gains at the Top will be opportunistic, uneven, and sporadic. Moreover, they will be subject to diminishing returns as specific computations become better explored.Performance gains after Moore{\textquoteright}s law ends.In the post-Moore era, improvements in computing power will increasingly come from technologies at the {\textquotedblleft}Top{\textquotedblright} of the computing stack, not from those at the {\textquotedblleft}Bottom{\textquotedblright}, reversing the historical trend.CREDIT: N. CARY/SCIENCEThe miniaturization of semiconductor transistors has driven the growth in computer performance for more than 50 years. As miniaturization approaches its limits, bringing an end to Moore{\textquoteright}s law, performance gains will need to come from software, algorithms, and hardware. We refer to these technologies as the {\textquotedblleft}Top{\textquotedblright} of the computing stack to distinguish them from the traditional technologies at the {\textquotedblleft}Bottom{\textquotedblright}: semiconductor physics and silicon-fabrication technology. In the post-Moore era, the Top will provide substantial performance gains, but these gains will be opportunistic, uneven, and sporadic, and they will suffer from the law of diminishing returns. Big system components offer a promising context for tackling the challenges of working at the Top.},

We introduce an approach to photolithography in which multiphoton absorption of pulsed 800-nanometer (nm) light is used to initiate cross-linking in a polymer photoresist and one-photon absorption of continuous-wave 800-nm light is used simultaneously to deactivate the photopolymerization. By employing spatial phase-shaping of the deactivation beam, we demonstrate the fabrication of features with scalable resolution along the beam axis, down to a 40-nm minimum feature size. We anticipate application of this technique for the fabrication of diverse two- and three-dimensional structures with a feature size that is a small fraction of the wavelength of the light employed.

Each signal sent out is entangled with an ancilla, which is retained. Detection takes place via an entangling measurement on the returning signal together with the ancilla. This paper shows that for photodetection, quantum illumination with m bits of entanglement can in principle increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2^m, an exponential improvement over unentangled illumination. The enhancement persists even when noise and loss are so great that no entanglement survives at the detector.

    abstract = { Throughout our evolutionary history, our cognitive systems have been altered by the advent of technological inventions such as primitive tools, spoken language, writing, and arithmetic systems. Thirty years ago, the Internet surfaced as the latest technological invention poised to deeply reshape human cognition. With its multifaceted affordances, the Internet environment has profoundly transformed our thoughts and behaviors. Growing up with Internet technologies, “Digital Natives” gravitate toward “shallow” information processing behaviors characterized by rapid attention shifting and reduced deliberations. They engage in increased multitasking behaviors that are linked to increased distractibility and poor executive control abilities. Digital natives also exhibit higher prevalence of Internet-related addictive behaviors that reflect altered reward-processing and self-control mechanisms. Recent neuroimaging investigations have suggested associations between these Internet-related cognitive impacts and structural changes in the brain. Against mounting apprehension over the Internet’s consequences on our cognitive systems, several researchers have lamented that these concerns were often exaggerated beyond existing scientific evidence. In the present review, we aim to provide an objective overview of the Internet’s impacts on our cognitive systems. We critically discuss current empirical evidence about how the Internet environment has altered the cognitive behaviors and structures involved in information processing, executive control, and reward-processing. }

dedicated I/O nodes and separate control and data networks, both of
which help. Stripe unit is 16 bytes per disk, which seems way too
small. They get good performance up in the hundreds of megabytes and
larger, scaling pretty well at about 1.0 MB/sec write per disk drive
and 1.5 MB/sec read per disk drive, up to 118 disk drives. Overhead
per parallel operation and small operations aren't well-described.
Supports odd block sizes, and they had to modify the SunOS FS data
structures (the control processor runs SunOS) and NFS to support large
files (this was pre-NFS V3). The control processor can export the
parallel FS as an NFS partition or do parallel operations within the
CM. The API for parallel work isn't covered here, and the paper uses
some terms oddly (and is poorly edited), but looks like good work.},

They stripe 16-byte quantities in a RAID-3 configuration across

sizes. And, of course, >2GB files, which required tinkering with the
SunOS file and VM systems. Uses separate control and data networks.

still left with a fuzzy picture of the architecture, though.},

ABSTRACT={We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.}

Here we ask the question of whether the noise affecting entangled states can be learned solely from the measurement statistics obtained during a distillation protocol. As a first step, we consider states of the Werner form and find that the Werner parameter can be estimated efficiently from the measurement statistics of an idealized distillation protocol. Our proposed estimation method can find application in scenarios where distillation is an unavoidable step.},

abstract = {Quantum computing has exciting potential but a current technological hurdle lies in the limited number of qubits in a single processor. One way to address this challenge is to assemble small, specialized quantum processors into a larger computing system, named distributed quantum computing. In this work, we focus on a key problem in distributed quantum computing: how to map logical qubits of a specific quantum circuit to different processors in a heterogeneous quantum network with the goal of minimizing the overall communication overhead. To solve this problem, we formulate a probability-aware qubit-to-processor mapping model, where the communication overhead between each pair of processors is determined through probabilistic analyses based on the link entanglement generation rates. We also introduce a multi-flow routing protocol in our model to improve the overall entanglement rates. Afterward, we employ a multistage hybrid simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the total communication overhead. Lastly, we perform extensive simulations to show the superiority of our solutions under a wide range of system settings.},

abstract ={The von Neumann architecture for a classical computer
                  comprises a central processing unit and a memory
                  holding instructions and data. We demonstrate a
                  quantum central processing unit that exchanges data
                  with a quantum random-access memory integrated on a
                  chip, with instructions stored on a classical
                  computer. We test our quantum machine by executing
                  codes that involve seven quantum elements: Two
                  superconducting qubits coupled through a quantum
                  bus, two quantum memories, and two zeroing
                  registers. Two vital algorithms for quantum
                  computing are demonstrated, the quantum Fourier
                  transform, with 66\% process fidelity, and the
                  three-qubit Toffoli-class OR phase gate, with 98\%
                  phase fidelity. Our results, in combination
                  especially with longer qubit coherence, illustrate a
                  potentially viable approach to factoring numbers and

Entanglement between a single photon (signal) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element (the atomic ensemble) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis. The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon (idler) from the (entangled) collective state of the ensemble. Faithful atomic memory preparation and readout are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons. These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking.

comment = {Work done at Cray Research on a shared FS on a networked
disk (a MaxStrat RAID array). The array still deals in blocks (64KB)
with IPI-3 commands. They built a custom box to implement the
semaphores needed for such activities as inode modifications. Later
versions use a SPARC for that, not clear why. On-disk inode structure
modified to include current locker and lock mode (shared-read v.
exclusive write). Although opening a file for read requires locking
it, then normal FS caching can be used. They get more than 80 MB/s in
this shared mode for large reads; no data on writes. DFS works, too.
Describes using third-party transfers when one C90 acts as a DFS
server, transferring directly from the array to the DFS client without
passing through the DFS server. Also talks about DMF interaction.
They're working on SFS on SCSI devices, and doing this with no
separate semaphore box.},

abstract ={Stable quantum bits, capable both of storing quantum information for macroscopic time scales and of integration inside small portable devices, are an essential building block for an array of potential applications. We demonstrate high-fidelity control of a solid-state qubit, which preserves its polarization for several minutes and features coherence lifetimes exceeding 1 second at room temperature. The qubit consists of a single 13C nuclear spin in the vicinity of a nitrogen-vacancy color center within an isotopically purified diamond crystal. The long qubit memory time was achieved via a technique involving dissipative decoupling of the single nuclear spin from its local environment. The versatility, robustness, and potential scalability of this system may allow for new applications in quantum information science.},

Coherent control is realized by irradiating the qubits directly with classical bitstreams derived from optimal control theory. Qubit measurement is performed by a Josephson photon counter, which provides access to the classical result of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage. We analyze the power budget and physical footprint of the SFQ coprocessor and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with this approach.}

comment = {Looks good at first glance, but seems to be missing some
things. I really don't understand how the service time for FTP puts
can possibly go up as the hit ratio on the HSM disk cache goes up,
unless it's due to increased disk thrashing due to higher concurrency
(better hit ratio means more requests active at once?). The
explanation of client interaction with the server is poor. Transfers
between NAPs are described but not definitively linked to the ftp put
and get operations. Some of the model parameters are underdocumented.
At least one reference is inaccurate. No throughput numbers,
everything's in completion times counting queueing. Closed queueing
network, I'm not sure that's right.}

To demonstrate, we built a 5.4-billion-transistor chip with 4096 neurosynaptic cores interconnected via an intrachip network that integrates 1 million programmable spiking neurons and 256 million configurable synapses. Chips can be tiled in two dimensions via an interchip communication interface, seamlessly scaling the architecture to a cortexlike sheet of arbitrary size. The architecture is well suited to many applications that use complex neural networks in real time, for example, multiobject detection and classification. With 400-pixel-by-240-pixel video input at 30 frames per second, the chip consumes 63 milliwatts.},

Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.

		  Xerox Distributed File System (XDFS).  Both use
		  transaction semantics in a session-oriented fashion, 
		  so a file must be opened, written, then closed.
		  They allocate shadow pages for the data for the
		  transaction, then have to go back and clean up on
		  the commit.  CFS uses cylinder maps (entries can be
		  allocated, free, intending-to-allocate or
		  intending-to-free) and object trees 
		  which hold redundant info, so structural integrity
		  is maintained.  XDFS uses B-trees for its base space 
		  allocation structure.  CFS has index files which
		  point to an object, and the index files can be
		  garbage collected.  Human-readable directories are
		  built on top of these. XDFS has no indices or
		  directories, so the clients can do whatever they
		  want, but if the client loses the handle for a file, 
		  there's no way to reclaim its space.  The CFS
		  garbage collector can run on any free processor on
		  the network.  CFS uses transferable capabilities to
		  determine access to files, rather than client
		  identity.  CFS is tailored to provide segment
		  backing store.  CFS has simple transactions for a
		  single writer, while XDFS supports complex,
		  multi-file transactions and multiple writers.  XDFS
		  is much slower because of the logging needed to
		  ensure atomicity on the transactions.  Both systems
		  use idempotent actions.  Suggests nonvolatile
		  RAM in the server.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is threatening current cryptography, especially the asymmetric algorithms used in many Internet protocols. More secure algorithms, colloquially referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), are under active development. These new algorithms differ significantly from current ones. They can have larger signatures or keys, and often require more computational power. This means we cannot just replace existing algorithms by PQC alternatives, but need to evaluate if they meet the requirements of the Internet protocols that rely on them.In this paper we provide a case study, analyzing the impact of PQC on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In its main role, DNS translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses and DNSSEC guarantees message integrity and authenticity. DNSSEC is particularly challenging to transition to PQC, since DNSSEC and its underlying transport protocols require small signatures and keys and efficient validation. We evaluate current candidate PQC signature algorithms in the third round of the NIST competition on their suitability for use in DNSSEC. We show that three algorithms, partially, meet DNSSEC's requirements but also show where and how we would still need to adapt DNSSEC. Thus, our research lays the foundation for making DNSSEC, and protocols with similar constraints ready for PQC.},

  comment = {Bill's "get all of the photons from one group, and at
                  least one of the photons from all of the groups" approach.
The basic scheme is this:  group copies of a qubit into n groups, each containing m photons.
\par
We need to receive all members of a group in order to correctly receive the data (qu)bit of that group.  So, the odds are (1-P)^m of getting all of them.  How many groups (n) do we need to have a high probability of receiving all of the photons in *at least one* of those groups?
\par
For the scheme to work, we have to be able to "back out" or correct for the information in the not-complete groups.  That means we need to get *at least one* photon in *all* of the other n-1 groups.  Turns out, with a high P, there is a balance point where you can reasonably expect to get all of one group, and at least one in all of the other groups.  The scheme works better with lower probability of reception if you encode multiple qubits in a single photon (position, timing, polarization, etc.) and a clever encoding.
\par
So far, this is a clever link-level scheme.  It takes advantage of a plentiful resource -- photonic pulses -- to minimize use of scarce resources -- qubit memories in general, and especially those with long lifetime.  It produces link-level entanglement with excellent probability, though I am dubious about the claims of high fidelity resulting.
\par
However, showing how the low-layer capabilities impact higher-level session architectures, the authors claim that this can be used to do fully hop-by-hop transmission of qubits!
\par
They set probability of E2E failure at 0.1\%, assume essentially perfect measurements and local gates (although there is a nod to the redundancy in the state being used to help offset measurement errors), and for P=0.2, require about 7,600 pulses per qubit they want to send.  With a 1GHz clock, that would mean 7.6usec per qubit, a factor I think they fail to take into account here.
\par
Requires:
* long lifetime memory: definitely no, unless app demands it
* high entanglement success probability: yes, unless you encode multiple qubits per photon
* high-fidelity entanglement: yes?  Fidelity seems to be under-discussed in this paper.
* high-fidelity local gates: yes

  comment={Okay, let's see if I can summarize what's important about this paper:
\par
* They recognized that fewer receivers balance more transmitters.
* Analyzed a QEC-based purification scheme (which I think is all initiated *post*-reception, triggered from the link receiver, though the writing & figures are a little unclear) that supports hop-by-hop propagation.  This affects session architecture and is very visible throughout the protocol stack, but does *not* change the quantum state put in the channel, it's still just trying to make a Bell pair.
  - Essentially, at every hop it takes every resource available and dedicates it to the production of the single best Bell pair it can make.  The operation is effectively the *de*coding circuit for a CSS code, if I understand correctly.  You mash all of the base-level Bell pairs down to a single, hi-fid physical pair, and then do physical-level entanglement swapping on that.
* Clock is synced to RTT of longest hop in the path.
* No E2E (or even multi-hop) purification required.
\par
This scheme requires:
* intermediate memory lifetime: usec instead of msec.  Probably the paper's biggest contribution.
* works w/ arbitrarily low reception probability?  (Existing analysis is P=0.2.)
* Seems to require intermediate to high base-level fidelity (F > 0.9); I think low-fid is probably only effective w/ purify and discarding lots of failures.
* high-fidelity local gates and measurements for the QEC/stabilizer/purification (they are a bit ambiguous here, trying to be general) operations.  Especially, the entanglement swapping operation happens on a raw physical pair, so is highly vulnerable to errors.  This is probably the biggest drawback to this scheme.  There is some discussion in the paper about adapting to keep that qubit (and possibly the on-wire state?) in a QEC-encoded state, but it's not well developed here.
\par
Questions:
* What happens when L->R and R->L links are interspersed?
\par

  abstract={The yield of physical qubits fabricated in the laboratory is much lower than that of classical transistors in production semiconductor fabrication. Actual implementations of quantum computers will be susceptible to loss in the form of physically faulty qubits. Though these physical faults must negatively affect the computation, we can deal with them by adapting error-correction schemes. In this paper we have simulated statically placed single-fault lattices and lattices with randomly placed faults at functional qubit yields of 80\%, 90\%, and 95\%, showing practical performance of a defective surface code by employing actual circuit constructions and realistic errors on every gate, including identity gates. We extend Stace et al 's superplaquettes solution against dynamic losses for the surface code to handle static losses such as physically faulty qubits [1]. The single-fault analysis shows that a static loss at the periphery of the lattice has less negative effect than a static loss at the center. The randomly faulty analysis shows that 95\% yield is good enough to build a large-scale quantum computer. The local gate error rate threshold is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/19/2/023050/njpaa5918ieqn1.gif] {$\sim 0.3 \% $} , and a code distance of seven suppresses the residual error rate below the original error rate at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/19/2/023050/njpaa5918ieqn2.gif] {$p=0.1 \% $} . 90\% yield is also good enough when we discard badly fabricated quantum computation chips, while 80\% yield does not show enough error suppression even when discarding 90\% of the chips. We evaluated several metrics for predicting chip performance, and found that the average of the product of the number of data qubits and the cycle time of a stabilizer measurement of stabilizers gave the strongest correlation with logical error rates. Our analysis will help with selecting usable quantum computation chips from among the pool of all fabricated chips.}

In order to run a generic quantum algorithm on such a platform, one has to transform the initial logical quantum circuit describing the algorithm into an equivalent one that obeys the connectivity restrictions. In this work we construct a circuit synthesis scheme that takes as input the qubit connectivity graph and a quantum circuit over the gate set generated by  and outputs a circuit that respects the connectivity of the device. As a concrete application, we apply our techniques to Google’s Bristlecone 72-qubit quantum chip connectivity, IBM’s Tokyo 20-qubit quantum chip connectivity, and Rigetti’s Acorn 19-qubit quantum chip connectivity. In addition, we also compare the performance of our scheme as a function of sparseness of randomly generated quantum circuits, and discuss how to apply our techniques as a subroutine for the more general mapping problem over universal set of gates (Clifford + T).}

about consistency of file attributes, especially length. Files remain
coherent even when open for write, but at a performance penalty.},

Quantum correlations are of high quality and persist on a millisecond time scale even at room temperature, which is adequate for sophisticated quantum operations.},

Our compilation tool development focuses on the fact that the error rates of individual qubits are not equal, with a goal of maximizing the success probability of real-world subroutines such as an adder circuit. We begin by establishing a metric for choosing among possible paths and circuit alternatives for executing gates between variables placed far apart within the processor, and test our approach on two IBM 20-qubit systems named Tokyo and Poughkeepsie. We find that a single-number metric describing the fidelity of individual gates is a useful but imperfect guide.Our compiler uses this subsystem and maps complete circuits onto the machine using a beam search-based heuristic that will scale as processor and program sizes grow. To evaluate the whole compilation process, we compiled and executed adder circuits, then calculated the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence, a measure of the distance between two probability distributions). For a circuit within the capabilities of the hardware, our compilation increases estimated success probability and reduces KL-divergence relative to an error-oblivious placement.},

abstract = {In 2001, all-optical quantum computing became feasible with the discovery that scalable quantum computing is possible using only single-photon sources, linear optical elements, and single-photon detectors. Although it was in principle scalable, the massive resource overhead made the scheme practically daunting. However, several simplifications were followed by proof-of-principle demonstrations, and recent approaches based on cluster states or error encoding have dramatically reduced this worrying resource overhead, making an all-optical architecture a serious contender for the ultimate goal of a large-scale quantum computer. Key challenges will be the realization of high-efficiency sources of indistinguishable single photons, low-loss, scalable optical circuits, high-efficiency single-photon detectors, and low-loss interfacing of these components.

We report teleportation of quantum information between atomic quantum memories separated by about 1 meter. A quantum bit stored in a single trapped ytterbium ion (Yb+) is teleported to a second Yb+ atom with an average fidelity of 90\% over a replete set of states. The teleportation protocol is based on the heralded entanglement of the atoms through interference and detection of photons emitted from each atom and guided through optical fibers. This scheme may be used for scalable quantum computation and quantum communication.

This kitten state is generated by subtracting one photon from a squeezed vacuum beam, and it clearly presents a negative Wigner function. The predicted influence of the experimental parameters is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The amplitude of the coherent states can be amplified to transform our "Schrodinger kittens" into bigger Schrodinger cats, providing an essential tool for quantum information processing.

pages="23--33",
abstract="The concept of quantum transition is critically examined from the perspective of the modern quantum theory of measurement. Historically rooted in the famous quantum jump of the Old Quantum Theory, the transition idea survives today in experimental jargon due to (1) the notion of uncontrollable disturbance of a system by measurement operations and (2) the wave-packet reduction hypothesis in several forms. Explicit counterexamples to both (1) and (2) are presented in terms of quantum measurement theory. It is concluded that the idea of transition, or quantum jump, can no longer be rationally comprehended within the framework of contemporary physical theory.",

The racetrack memory described in this review comprises an array of magnetic nanowires arranged horizontally or vertically on a silicon chip. Individual spintronic reading and writing nanodevices are used to modify or read a train of 竏ｼ10 to 100 domain walls, which store a series of data bits in each nanowire. This racetrack memory is an example of the move toward innately three-dimensional microelectronic devices.},

corny. Change the I/O interface visible to the programmer, and
separate the actions of moving data and accessing data. Data is
virtually moved when I/O is performed, so the sender loses access to
it. ``Unloading'' a container (making its contents accessible) returns
you the address to use -- no ``put data in my pre-allocated buffer
here'' interface. References Tenex and Fbufs work. Gets excellent
speedup in process pipelines when intermediate processes do little
actual data touching. [Extending to distributed memory systems or
allowing execution ``futures'' or supporting 3rd party network I/O
this way would be interesting.]}}

  comment = {The circuit is complete and apparently well thought out,
                  though I haven't totally grokked it yet.  Uses
                  Zalka's QFT-based (n.b.: FFT-based?) adder, claiming
                  it's constant depth.  Some clever optimizations
                  assuming that a the five-gate breakdown of a Toffoli
                  is legit.  They avoid the modulo operation after
                  each addition by doing multiplication (in the
                  Fourier domain), then dividing as necessary.  The
                  division algorithm is complex, haven't worked
                  through it step by step yet.  They seem to divide by
                  n by multiplying by 1/n, which is good if done with
                  care.  Most of the work is in correctly cleaning up,
                  of course.  Problems: I don't believe in Zalka's
                  adder, they don't consider S-K decompositions
                  anyway, no discussion of fault tolerance or
                  architecture, despite the word in the title.}

The formula can be applied to averages over particularly relevant subspaces; it is easily generalized to multi-component systems, and as a special result, we show that when the same completely positive trace-preserving map is applied to a large number of qubits with one-bit fidelity F close to unity, the average fidelity of the operation on the full K-bit register scales as F3K/2."

                  nearby GaAs nuclei, which cause decoherence.  If I
                  have this right, they prepare the (0,2) singlet
                  (S = 0) state (both in R dot, |ud> + |du>?).  They
                  then separate (based on spin) the two electrons,
                  evolve, then project back onto the (0,2)S state to
                  measure.  "Native" decoherence time T2* is ~10nsec.
                  Adding the swapping back and forth, they get
                  >1usec.  Measurement is measurement of the
                  conductance of the R dot, and requires an additional
                  structure.  For these experiments, prep time is
                  200nsec, the electrons are separated for ~200nsec,
                  then brought back together for measurement for
                  5-10usec (a long time!).  The amount of time they
                  can be separated depends on magnetic field; with
                  zero field, drops off to 0.5 prob. singlet
                  measurement after 20nsec; for 100mT, 0.7, after
                  which it saturates.  Says their approach is
                  effectively a DFS.  Says all prep, protecting and
                  measurement can be done by local electrostatic
                  control.  I think this means gates require local

We prepare the teleporter through photon-mediated heralded entanglement between two distant electron spins and subsequently encode the source qubit in a single nuclear spin. By realizing a fully deterministic Bell-state measurement combined with real-time feed-forward quantum teleportation is achieved upon each attempt with an average state fidelity exceeding the classical limit. These results establish diamond spin qubits as a prime candidate for the realization of quantum networks for quantum communication and network-based quantum computing.},

We consider protocols where the local devices are imperfect, and show that nonetheless a confidential quantum channel can be established, and used to e.g. perform distributed quantum computation in a secure manner. While our results are not fully device independent (which we argue to be unachievable in settings with quantum outputs), our proof holds for arbitrary channel noise and noisy local operations, and even in the case where the eavesdropper learns the noise. Our approach relies on non-trivial properties of distillation protocols which are used in conjunction with de-Finetti and post-selection-type techniques to reduce a general quantum attack in a non-asymptotic scenario to an i.i.d. setting. As a side result, we also provide entanglement distillation protocols for non-i.i.d. input states.}

In this paper, we provideboth a general introduction and a state-of-the-art description of therecent advances in the field, both theoretical and experimental. We startby reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discretevariable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence,satellite challenges, and protocols based on continuous-variable systems.We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point privatecommunications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome theserestrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantumcryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantumrandom number generators and quantum digital signatures.},

abstract={This paper addresses multi-user quantum key distribution networks, in which any two users can mutually exchange a secret key without trusting any other nodes. The same network also supports conventional classical communications by assigning two different wavelength bands to quantum and classical signals. Time and code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques, within a passive star network, are considered. In the case of CDMA, it turns out that the optimal performance is achieved at a unity code weight. A listen-before-send protocol is then proposed to improve secret key generation rates in this case. Finally, a hybrid setup with wavelength routers and passive optical networks, which can support a large number of users, is considered and analyzed.},

We investigate the maximum number C(P) of arguments of P that must be tested in order to compute P, a Boolean function of d Boolean arguments. We present evidence for the general conjecture that C(P) = d whenever P(0d) ≠ P(1d) and P is invariant under a transitive permutation group acting on the arguments. A non-constructive argument (not based on the construction of an “oracle”) settles this question for d a prime power. We use this result to prove the Aanderaa-Rosenberg conjecture: at least v216 entries of the adjacency matrix of a v-vertex undirected graph G must be examined in the worst case to determine if G has any given non-trivial monotone graph property."

abstract ={The development of small-scale quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and detect quantum speedup. Here, we show how to define and measure quantum speedup and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake such a speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from tests run on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. By using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we found no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtained inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the quantum speedup question.},

  title={A quantum circuit to find discrete logarithms on binary elliptic curves in depth O (log\^{} 2 n)},
  author={R{\"o}tteler, Martin and Steinwandt, Rainer},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.1161},
  year={2013},
  comment={Accepted to QIC.  After reflection, it's a somewhat less egregious omission than I originally felt, since he's focusing on a new way of calculating the elliptic curve side of Shor, which I haven't focused on and can't even claim to fully understand.
\par
Nevertheless, it wound me up when I saw a section title, "Parallelizing Shor's Algorithm," as if he is the first discoverer of the fact that it can be broken down and run in parallel.
\par
Still trying to figure out how to word an email to him without biting his head off :-).
\par
Except for one throwaway paragraph in the conclusions, where he cites one recent paper by an intern who worked with Krysta (who I think is now his boss) and one by Sandy Kutin, he completely ignores all of the work on circuits for the modular exponentiation that is the core of factoring.  Vedral and Beckman did the seminal work, of course, and the core idea of tree-based parallelization arguably belongs to Cleve (who Martin actually *did* cite), but my Phys Rev A paper covered a lot of ground in tradeoffs and parallelization.  Back before Austin Fowler, Simon Devitt and I knew each other, they and I worked independently on interconnect-constrained implementations of modular exponentiation; theirs was published a few months before mine (I never liked their implementation, but that's beside the point).  Draper's beautiful log-depth carry lookahead adder (on which Krysta is a coauthor) appeared on the arXiv before my PRA, but the paper was published afterwards.  Byung-Soo Choi and I formalized the connection between interconnect topology and addition depth in a paper a couple of years ago, though some still seem to think that limit can be beaten.  Except for Cleve, Martin cited none of these.
\par
Personally, I'm opposed to all of the QFT-based addition circuits; my gut tells me those are very, very, very far from practical.  Simon still seems to favor them, for reasons I can't figure out.  Unlike the QFT at the end of Shor's algorithm, I don't believe it's acceptable to use an *approximate* QFT when doing addition, since you can't have an answer that is "approximately" a factor.  And we know that the Solovay-Kitaev decomposition of the small angles in that will be hideously expensive.  Just stick with ripple-carry adders, unless you're lucky enough to have a rich interconnect, is my opinion.
\par
I'm not opposed to theoretical research on the math underlying the algorithms, but after a decade of work by the people I just listed, I think it's bordering on irresponsible of reviewers to not require more attention to the relationship between the interconnect topology and any claimed-to-be-feasible circuit.  This is especially true given what we now know about implementing circuits on top of quantum error correction.  The surface code, in particular, offers very complex tradeoffs of space.
\par
...and, of course, the ultimate bound, if you want to talk real _limits_ is \Omega(n^{1/3}) or worse, since the qubits must be held in physical devices packed into a 3-D space.  (For that matter, I _think_ the reviewers let Martin get away with some sloppiness on O(), \Omega(), and \Theta(), but not sure yet.)
\par
Note that he has written a paper about arithmetic that doesn't use the word "carry".  The math is couched in such abstract terms, that I can't follow all of it, and it certainly is not a proof by construction, the circuits are only sketched very, very roughly.
\par
Perhaps I'm just not reading it carefully enough, but I have a lot of trouble extracting from this paper the sizes of the variables involved.  I can't figure out whether \alpha_i in Eq. 3 is an integer, a real number, a complex amplitude, or a bit.  I think they are just bits, but I'm not certain.
\par
Toffoli gates are mentioned only once (p. 6), in a way that suggests that the alpha and beta values are bits, but I can't tell exactly what happens after the bitwise products are created; I can't figure out how to scale Fig. 3 at all.  I think perhaps the most important thing in that figure is the mysterious last CNOT, but I'm not sure.  Are all bits calculated purely mod 2?  Is there no carry necessary in this circuit?
\par
The addition of a classical number to the register conditional upon the value of a quantum bit  (p. 8) is a technique pioneered by Beckman.
\par
I see no evidence at all that Martin has any understanding of arithmetic _circuits_, or of the literature around adapting them to quantum systems.
\par
I also don't fully understand the mathematical trick that turns the modular exponentiation into the simpler matrix multiply and add, although that comes from Maslov.  I ignored elliptic curve way back when, because the simplest way to implement that was using the same modular exponentiation, except with one of the arguments classically inverted, to turn the difficult division into a simpler multiplication.  This newer trick I'm not familiar with...}

 abstract = {The Linux Kernel currently supports at least 8 distinct
                  virtualization systems: Xen, KVM, VMware's VMI,
                  IBM's System p, IBM's System z, User Mode Linux,
                  lguest and IBM's legacy iSeries. It seems likely
                  that more such systems will appear, and until
                  recently each of these had its own block, network,
                  console and other drivers with varying features and
                  optimizations.  The attempt to address this is
                  virtio: a series of efficient, well-maintained Linux
                  drivers which can be adapted for various different
                  hypervisor implementations using a shim layer. This
                  includes a simple extensible feature mechanism for
                  each driver. We also provide an obvious ring buffer
                  transport implementation called vring, which is
                  currently used by KVM and lguest. This has the
                  subtle effect of providing a path of least
                  resistance for any new hypervisors: supporting this
                  efficient transport mechanism will immediately
                  reduce the amount of work which needs to be
                  done. Finally, we provide an implementation which
                  presents the vring transport and device
                  configuration as a PCI device: this means guest
                  operating systems merely need a new PCI driver, and
                  hypervisors need only add vring support to the
                  virtual devices they implement (currently only KVM
                  does this).  This paper will describe the virtio API
                  layer as implemented in Linux, then the vring
                  implementation, and finally its embodiment in a PCI
                  device for simple adoption on otherwise
                  fully-virtualized guests. We'll wrap up with some of
                  the preliminary work to integrate this I/O mechanism
                  deeper into the Linux host kernel.}

Electron and nuclear spin qubits using shallow neutral donors in semiconductors have been studied extensively but are limited to low temperatures (≲10 kelvin); however, the nuclear spins of ionized donors have the potential for high-temperature operation. We used optical methods and dynamical decoupling to realize this potential for an ensemble of phosphorous-31 donors in isotopically purified silicon-28 and observed a room-temperature coherence time of over 39 minutes. We further showed that a coherent spin superposition can be cycled from 4.2 kelvin to room temperature and back, and we report a cryogenic coherence time of 3 hours in the same system.},

abstract="The decoherence effect on Grover algorithm has been studied numerically through a noise modelled by a depolarizing channel. Two types of error are introduced characterizing the qubit time evolution and gate application, so the noise is directly related to the quantum network construction. The numerical simulation concludes an exponential damping law for the successive probability of the maxima as time increases. We have obtained an allowed-error law for the algorithm: the error threshold for the allowed noise behaves as $\epsilon$th(N) ∼1/N1.1 (N being the size of the data set). As the power of N is almost one, we consider the Grover algorithm as robust to a certain extent against decoherence. This law also provides an absolute threshold: if the free evolution error is greater than 0.043, Grover algorithm does not work for any number of qubits affected by the present error model. The improvement in the probability of success, in the case of two qubits has been illustrated by using a fault-tolerant encoding of the initial state by means of the [[7,1,3]] quantum code. ",

  abstract={Quantum key distribution network has become a reality in
                  practical environment. Quantum repeaters have been
                  explored in various physical systems and their
                  combinations. For practical use of them, these new
                  paradigms must be combined with existing or emerging
                  infrastructures of communication and security
                  systems. In this article, we discussed how quantum
                  network can be combined with modern cryptographic
                  technologies in fibre network and with emerging
                  mobile terminals in wireless network, creating new
                  solutions for the future cryptographic and
                  communication systems. Our discussions are
                  summarised in a roadmap.},

  abstract={In quantum networking, repeater hijacking menaces the security and utility of quantum applications. To deal with this problem, it is important to take a measure of the impact of quantum repeater hijacking. First, we quantify the work of each quantum repeater with regards to each quantum communication. Based on this, we show the costs for repeater hijacking detection using distributed quantum state tomography and the amount of work loss and rerouting penalties caused by hijacking. This quantitative evaluation covers both purification-entanglement swapping and quantum error correction repeater networks. Naive implementation of the checks necessary for correct network operation can be subverted by a single hijacker to bring down an entire network. Fortunately, the simple fix of randomly assigned testing can prevent such an attack.}

The task of solving the game, determining the final result in a game with no mistakes made by either player, is daunting. Since 1989, almost continuously, dozens of computers have been working on solving checkers, applying state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to the proving process. This paper announces that checkers is now solved: Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. This is the most challenging popular game to be solved to date, roughly one million times as complex as Connect Four. Artificial intelligence technology has been used to generate strong heuristic-based game-playing programs, such as Deep Blue for chess. Solving a game takes this to the next level by replacing the heuristics with perfection.},

In addition to providing detailed logical resource estimates, it is also the purpose of this paper to demonstrate explicitly (using a fine-grained approach rather than relying on coarse big-O asymptotic approximations) how these impressively large numbers arise with an actual circuit implementation of a quantum algorithm. While our estimates may prove to be conservative as more efficient advanced quantum-computation techniques are developed, they nevertheless provide a valid baseline for research targeting a reduction of the algorithmic-level resource requirements, implying that a reduction by many orders of magnitude is necessary for the algorithm to become practical.",

abstract ={The computational potential of a quantum processor can only be unleashed if errors during a quantum computation can be controlled and corrected for. Quantum error correction works if imperfections of quantum gate operations and measurements are below a certain threshold and corrections can be applied repeatedly. We implement multiple quantum error correction cycles for phase-flip errors on qubits encoded with trapped ions. Errors are corrected by a quantum-feedback algorithm using high-fidelity gate operations and a reset technique for the auxiliary qubits. Up to three consecutive correction cycles are realized, and the behavior of the algorithm for different noise environments is analyzed.},

abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.

  abstract={Results obtained by an advanced growth of site-controlled quantum dots (SCQDs) on pre-patterned nanoholes and their integration into both photonic resonators and nanoelectronic memories are summarized. A specific technique has been pursued to improve the optical quality of single SCQDs. Quantum dot (QD) layers have been vertically stacked but spectrally detuned for single SCQD studies. Thereby, the average emission linewidth of single QDs could be reduced from 2.3 meV for SCQDs in a first QD layer close to the etched nanoholes down to600 µeV in the third InAs QD layer. Accurate SCQD nucleation on large QD distances is maintained by vertical strain induced QD coupling throughout the QD stacks. Record narrow linewidths of individual SCQDs down to ~110 µeV have been obtained. Experiments performed on coupled photonic SCQD–resonator devices show an enhancement of spontaneous emission. SCQDs have also been integrated deterministically in high electron mobility heterostructures and flash memory operation at room temperature has been observed.}

Here, we demonstrate a two-color irradiation scheme whereby initiating species are generated by single-photon absorption at one wavelength while inhibiting species are generated by single-photon absorption at a second, independent wavelength. Co-irradiation at the second wavelength thus reduces the polymerization rate, delaying gelation of the material and facilitating enhanced spatial control over the polymerization. Appropriate overlapping of the two beams produces structures with both feature sizes and monomer conversions otherwise unobtainable with use of single- or two-photon absorption photopolymerization. Additionally, the generated inhibiting species rapidly recombine when irradiation with the second wavelength ceases, allowing for fast sequential exposures not limited by memory effects in the material and thus enabling fabrication of complex two- or three-dimensional structures.

grouped shortest time first do well on both response time variance and
utilization. The disk is modelled carefully, but they still use the
"average" seek time for some things.},

abstract="To realize efficient quantum communication based on quantum repeater, we propose a secure quantum network coding scheme for controlled repeater networks, which adds a controller as a trusted party and is able to control the process of EPR-pair distribution. As the key operations of quantum repeater, local operations and quantum communication are designed to adopt quantum one-time pad to enhance the function of identity authentication instead of local operations and classical communication. Scheme analysis shows that the proposed scheme can defend against active attacks for quantum communication and realize long-distance quantum communication with minimal resource consumption.",

With the CNOT gates, our EPP can reach a higher fidelity than the conventional one. Moreover, it does not require the fidelity of the initial mixed state to satisfy F > 1/2. If the initial state is not entangled, it still can be purified. With the linear optics, this protocol can get pure maximally entangled pairs with some probabilities. Meanwhile, it can be used to purify the entanglement between the atomic ensembles in distant locations. This protocol may be useful in long-distance quantum communication.}

abstract = {How will superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) affect human decision-making? And what will be the mechanisms behind this effect? We address these questions in a domain where AI already exceeds human performance, analyzing more than 5.8 million move decisions made by professional Go players over the past 71 y (1950 to 2021). To address the first question, we use a superhuman AI program to estimate the quality of human decisions across time, generating 58 billion counterfactual game patterns and comparing the win rates of actual human decisions with those of counterfactual AI decisions. We find that humans began to make significantly better decisions following the advent of superhuman AI. We then examine human players’ strategies across time and find that novel decisions (i.e., previously unobserved moves) occurred more frequently and became associated with higher decision quality after the advent of superhuman AI. Our findings suggest that the development of superhuman AI programs may have prompted human players to break away from traditional strategies and induced them to explore novel moves, which in turn may have improved their decision-making. }}

abstract ={Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems faster than classical computers. To exploit their power, it is necessary to perform interqubit operations and generate entangled states. Spin qubits are a promising candidate for implementing a quantum processor because of their potential for scalability and miniaturization. However, their weak interactions with the environment, which lead to their long coherence times, make interqubit operations challenging. We performed a controlled two-qubit operation between singlet-triplet qubits using a dynamically decoupled sequence that maintains the two-qubit coupling while decoupling each qubit from its fluctuating environment. Using state tomography, we measured the full density matrix of the system and determined the concurrence and the fidelity of the generated state, providing proof of entanglement.},

                  and demonstrate a CPHASE gate between them.  Each
                  logical qubit is a form of decoherence free subspace
                  (DFS), where they use a singlet state and one triplet
                  state as the north and south poles of the Bloch
                  sphere.  They seem to get only about one CPHASE
                  gate, and despite using a DFS their lifetime is not
                  long; they can prove entanglement up to about
                  200nsec.  Two-qubit gate time is something like
                  140nsec, and measurement time is the big problem --
                  they integrate over something like a full

                  a number of commercial disk cache products, mostly
                  at the controller.  Actual performance improvements
                  appear to be modest due to limitations of the
                  implementation and the fact that controller cache
                  hit overhead is not dramatically different from a

A fundamental bound on quantum error correction is the quantum capacity, which quantifies the amount of quantum data that can be protected. We show theoretically that two quantum channels, each with a transmission capacity of zero, can have a nonzero capacity when used together. This unveils a rich structure in the theory of quantum communications, implying that the quantum capacity does not completely specify a channel's ability to transmit quantum information.

abstract = {Abstract.
                  With the goal of designing interferometers and interferometer sensors, e.g., LADARs with enhanced sensitivity, resolution, and phase estimation, states using quantum entanglement are discussed. These states include N00N states, plain M and M states (PMMSs), and linear combinations of M and M states (LCMMS). Closed form expressions for the optimal detection operators; visibility, a measure of the state‚ robustness to loss and noise; a resolution measure; and phase estimate error, are provided in closed form. The optimal resolution for the maximum visibility and minimum phase error are found. For the visibility, comparisons between PMMSs, LCMMS, and N00N states are provided. For the minimum phase error, comparisons between LCMMS, PMMSs, N00N states, separate photon states (SPSs), the shot noise limit (SNL), and the Heisenberg limit (HL) are provided. A representative collection of computational results illustrating the superiority of LCMMS when compared to PMMSs and N00N states is given. It is found that for a resolution 12 times the classical result LCMMS has visibility 11 times that of N00N states and 4 times that of PMMSs. For the same case, the minimum phase error for LCMMS is 10.7 times smaller than that of PMMS and 29.7 times smaller than that of N00N states.},

Therefore, its dynamics and traffic unsurprisingly take on a rich variety of complex dynamics, self-organization, and other phenomena that have been researched for years. This paper is a review of the complex dynamics of Internet traffic. Departing from normal treatises, we will take a view from both the network engineering and physics perspectives showing the strengths and weaknesses as well as insights of both. In addition, many less covered phenomena such as traffic oscillations, BGP storms, and comparisons of the Internet and biological models will be covered. }

                  For a two-level, inner/outer code concatenation, if

                  ni*no physical qubits, so [[23,1,7]] with
                  [[127,29,15]] is about 2900 physical for 29 logical
                  qubits.  Hmm, Steane says scale-up of around 1000
                  for that code (p.14)?  Where does the extra 10x come
                  from?  And his table I (p. 9) compared w/

                  ancillae, resulting in total consumption being ~4n
                  for k qubits, even when nrep = 1.  Acknowledges but

abstract = {Abstract Quantum error correction methods use processing power to combat noise. The noise level which can be tolerated in a fault-tolerant method is therefore a function of the computational resources available, especially the size of computer and degree of parallelism. I present an analysis of error correction with block codes, made fault-tolerant through the use of prepared ancilla blocks. The preparation and verification of the ancillas is described in detail. It is shown that the ancillas need only be verified against a small set of errors. This, combined with previously known advantages, makes this ’︁ancilla factory‚ the best method to apply error correction, whether in concatenated or block coding. I then consider the resources required to achieve 2 · 1010 computational steps reliably in a computer of 2150 logical qubits, finding that the simplest [[n, 1, d]] block codes can tolerate more noise with smaller overheads than the 7L-bit concatenated code. The scaling is such that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to contemplate.},

abstract ={A quantum computer requires systems that are isolated from their environment, but can be integrated into devices, and whose states can be measured with high accuracy. Nuclear spins in solids promise long coherence lifetimes, but they are difficult to initialize into known states and to detect with high sensitivity. We show how the distinctive optical properties of enriched 28Si enable the use of hyperfine-resolved optical transitions, as previously applied to great effect for isolated atoms and ions in vacuum. Together with efficient Auger photoionization, these resolved hyperfine transitions permit rapid nuclear hyperpolarization and electrical spin-readout. We combine these techniques to detect nuclear magnetic resonance from dilute 31P in the purest available sample of 28Si, at concentrations inaccessible to conventional measurements, measuring a solid-state coherence time of over 180 seconds.},

The network was installed in the Geneva metropolitan area and ran for more than one-and-a-half years, from the end of March 2009 to the beginning of January 2011. The main goal of this experiment was to test the reliability of the quantum layer over a long period of time in a production environment. A key management layer has been developed to manage the key between the three nodes of the network. This QKD-secure network was utilized by end-users through an application layer.}

abstract = {Most reported power laws lack statistical support and mechanistic backing. The ability to summarize observations using explanatory and predictive theories is the greatest strength of modern science. A theoretical framework is perceived as particularly successful if it can explain very disparate facts. The observation that some apparently complex phenomena can exhibit startling similarities to dynamics generated with simple mathematical models (1) has led to empirical searches for fundamental laws by inspecting data for qualitative agreement with the behavior of such models. A striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power-law relationships in empirical data. However, although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the Internet, the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost always too limited for the identification of power-law behavior to be scientifically useful (see the figure). Indeed, even most statistically “successful” calculations of power laws offer little more than anecdotal value.}}

They striped across 3-57 disks, getting good scalability, but JohnH
points out that the measurements are very preliminary -- doesn't say
what benchmarks, how repeatable the tests are, etc. They handle large
directories well due to easier indexing because of the data structures
and metadata logging (which could be on a separate device). Uses a
separate volume manager to control striping, hiding data layout from
the FS, which might or might not be a good idea. XLV produces 7.0
MB/sec per drive read and 5.5 write scalable, but doesn't say what
type of disks. System is big, 50k lines of code. No fsck generally
needed because of metadata logging, but occassionally needed after
HW/SW faults, and no fsck exists for it yet.}}

  abstract={Quantum aided Byzantine agreement is an important distributed quantum algorithm with unique features in comparison to classical deterministic and randomized algorithms, requiring only a constant expected number of rounds in addition to giving a higher level of security. In this paper, we analyze details of the high level multi-party algorithm, and propose elements of the design for the quantum architecture and circuits required at each node to run the algorithm on a quantum repeater network (QRN). Our optimization techniques have reduced the quantum circuit depth by 44\% and the number of qubits in each node by 20\% for a minimum five-node setup compared to the design based on the standard arithmetic circuits. These improvements lead to a quantum system architecture with 160 qubits per node, space-time product (an estimate of the required fidelity) {${KQ}\approx 1.3\times {10}^{5}$} per node and error threshold {$1.1\times {10}^{-6}$} for the total nodes in the network. The evaluation of the designed architecture shows that to execute the algorithm once on the minimum setup, we need to successfully distribute a total of 648 Bell pairs across the network, spread evenly between all pairs of nodes. This framework can be considered a starting point for establishing a road-map for light-weight demonstration of a distributed quantum application on QRNs.}

Suzuki et al. have pointed out two main factors in \[Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 061116 (2006)\], which degrade the observed squeezing level:phase fluctuation in homodyne measurement and intracavity losses of an optical parametric oscillator for squeezing. We have improved the phase stability of homodyne measurement and have reduced the intracavity losses. We measure pump power dependences of the squeezing and antisqueezing levels, which show good agreement with theoretical calculations taking account of the phase fluctuation.},

  abstract={We introduce a novel scheme for one-way quantum computing (QC) based on the use of information encoded qubits in an effective cluster state resource. With the correct encoding structure, we show that it is possible to protect the entangled resource from phase damping decoherence, where the effective cluster state can be described as residing in a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) of its supporting quantum system. One-way QC then requires either single or two-qubit adaptive measurements. As an example where this proposal can be realized, we describe an optical lattice set-up where the scheme provides robust quantum information processing. We also outline how one can adapt the model to provide protection from other types of decoherence.}

abstract = {A scalable and robust infrastructure for arbitrary quantum communication and distributed quantum computation will realize enhanced as well as new applications that are beyond the reach of classical communication networks. Quantum internetworking, which achieves large-scale quantum networks by building recursively on smaller quantum networks, is a promising approach. However, there are two big difficulties: decomposing end-to-end quantum communication, which is actually a complex distributed computing spanning classical and quantum computing, into processing for each subnetwork; and supporting future network functionality sustainably. In this work, we propose design principles for a quantum internetworking protocol based on the quantum recursive network architecture (QRNA) utilizing the RuleSet-based approach. We design two distinct approaches for recursion in quantum networks, namely link- and node-recursion. We demonstrate how end-to-end Bell pairs are generated over our internetworking systems, and evaluate the scaling of inputs to the distributed processing, via implementation on the Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). Our subnetwork recursion demonstrates the long-term future scalability as the size of and demands made on the Quantum Internet.},

Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.

  abstract={This communication presents the complete design of a reversible arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that can be part of a programmable reversible computing device such as a quantum computer. The presented ALU is garbage free and uses reversible updates to combine the standard reversible arithmetic and logical operations in one unit. Combined with a suitable control unit, the ALU permits the construction of an r-Turing complete computing device. The garbage-free ALU developed in this communication requires only 6 n elementary reversible gates for five basic arithmetic logical operations on two n -bit operands and does not use ancillae. This remarkable low resource consumption was achieved by generalizing the V-shape design first introduced for quantum ripple-carry adders and nesting multiple V-shapes in a novel integrated design. This communication shows that the realization of an efficient reversible ALU for a programmable computing device is possible and that the V-shape design is a very versatile approach to the design of quantum networks.}

combinatorial search among a frustrated set of states
characterized by a cost function to be minimized. The algorithm
is probabilistic, with post-selection of the measurement result.
A unique parameter playing the role of an effective temperature
governs  the computational load and the overall quality of the
optimization. Any level of accuracy can be reached with a
computational load independent of  the dimension N of the
search set by choosing the effective temperature correspondingly
low. This is much better than classical search heuristics, which
typically involve computation times growing as powers of
log(N).},

With the assistance of semi-honest quantum certificate authorities (QCAs), the remote users can share a secret key through fault-tolerant entanglement swapping. The proposed protocol is feasible for large-scale distributed quantum networks with numerous users. Each pair of communicating parties only needs to establish the quantum channels and the classical authenticated channels with his/her local QCA. Thus, it enables any user to communicate freely without point-to-point pre-establishing any communication channels, which is efficient and feasible for practical environments.",

Experiments reported in the open literature have included those conducted along horizontal propagation paths of varying distances, as well as communication paths from ground-to-aircraft, ground-to-space, and demonstrations in the laboratory. Available data characterize propagation distances, transmission speeds, quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, and quantum bit error rates (QBER). While fiber optic implementations of quantum communications technologies are currently being tested for communications infrastructure it is important to also consider that free-space quantum communications will play an important role in securing such applications as earth-to-satellite, end of line connects, and defense implementations.},

	abstract = {Secure communication is of paramount importance in modern society. Asymmetric cryptography methods such as the widely used RSA cryptosystem allow secure exchange of information between parties who have never previously shared keys. However, the existing asymmetric cryptographic schemes rely on unproven mathematical assumptions for security. Further, the digital keys used in their implementation are susceptible to copying that might remain unnoticed. Here, we introduce a secure communication method based on Physical Unclonable Keys (PUKs), which we call PUK-Enabled Asymmetric Communication (PEAC). PEAC uses physical keys and thus overcomes the problem of unnoticed copying. As all the information about the PUK is allowed to be public, PEAC does not require the safekeeping of any digital information. Using optical PUKs realized in opaque scattering materials, we transmit messages in an error-corrected way employing off-the-shelf equipment. Information is transmitted as patterned wavefronts of few-photon wavepackets which can be successfully decrypted only with the receiver’s PUK. The security of PEAC assumes technological constraints in distinguishing between different few-photon wavefronts. A heuristic argument for the security of PEAC is outlined focusing on a specific attack, namely state estimation. We demonstrate secure transmission of messages over a 2 m free-space line-of-sight quantum channel. PEAC enables new directions for physical key based cryptography.}

comment = {Fine-grained media are defined as those that can be read in
their entirety in a short period of time relative to their access time
-- for removable media, say, in an autochanger, one to two minutes
would be fine-grained. Access to such media can be made flexible and
fast by using a simple linear block layout, rather than striping, and
pipelining access for very long operations through the use of
extensive buffering in the host. The overall efficiency can be raised
from 50\% for striping to ~80\% for four-way pipelining for a specific
high-speed magneto-optical system.  Pipelining also offers more
flexibility than striping for both access patterns and hardware
configurations and could be considered more fault-tolerant.  The paper
is kind of weak, but the idea is original as far as I know.}}

abstract = "Hop-by-hop inter-domain routing protocols, such as border gateway protocol (BGP) and inter-domain routing protocol (IDRP), use independent route selection to realize domains' local policies. A domain chooses its routes based on path attributes present in a route. It is widely believed that these inter-domain routing protocols always converge. We show that there exist domain policies that cause BGP/IDRP to exhibit persistent oscillations. In these oscillations, each domain repeatedly chooses a sequence of routes to a destination. Complex oscillation patterns can occur even in very simple topologies. We analyze the conditions for persistent route oscillations in a simple class of inter-domain topologies and policies. Using this analysis, we evaluate ways to prevent or avoid persistent oscillations in general topologies. We conclude that if a hop-by-hop inter-domain routing protocol allows unconstrained route selection at a domain, the protocol may be susceptible to route oscillations. Constraining route selection to a provably “safe”procedure (such as shortest path) can reduce the number of realizable policies. Alternatively, a routing policy registry can help detect unsafe policies."

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the abundance of recurring elementary interaction patterns in complex networks, often called subgraphs or motifs, carry significant information about their function and overall organization. Yet, the underlying reasons for the variable quantity of different subgraph types, their propensity to form clusters, and their relationship with the networks' global organization remain poorly understood. Here we show that a network's large-scale topological organization and its local subgraph structure mutually define and predict each other, as confirmed by direct measurements in five well studied cellular networks. We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs, the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The identified topological framework may have important implications for our understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks.

abstract = {
The problem of distributing a secret key by quantum channels is one of the preeminent problems in quantum information. To construct such a quantum channel, it is useful to use quantum repeaters, which shorten the distance over which individual photons need to be sent, and thus overcoming the problem of attenuation. Here, we present a method by which a quantum repeater network may be constructed using only existing technology. By taking advantage of the robustness of the processes of double-heralding and brokering, a thorough analysis of the system shows that this gives secret key rates on the order of kilohertz, even over distances of thousands of kilometres.

                  defeating the FFS cylinder group, produces
                  startlingly good results.  Reduces average seek
                  distance on an 800 cylinder drive from 100 to <30

                  cleanly on modern, zoned disk drives, and even if it

The building blocks for this network are binary cells capable of permuting their two input terminals to their two output terminals.The number of cells used by the network is 〈n · log2 n - n + 1〉 = Σn k=1 〈log2 k〉. It could be argued that for such a network this number of cells is a lower bound, by noting that binary decision trees in the network can resolve individual terminal assignments only and not the partitioning of the permutation set itself which requires only 〈log2 n!〉 = 〈Σn k=1 log2 k〉 binary decisions.An algorithm is also given for the setting of the binary cells in the network according to any specified permutation.},

	abstract = {As indispensable as the internet has become in our daily lives, it still has many shortcomings, not least of which is that communication can be intercepted and information stolen. If, however, the internet attained the capability of transmitting quantum information{\textemdash}qubits{\textemdash}many of these security concerns would be addressed. Wehner et al. review what it will take to achieve this so-called quantum internet and propose stages of development that each correspond to increasingly powerful applications. Although a full-blown quantum internet, with functional quantum computers as nodes connected through quantum communication channels, is still some ways away, the first long-range quantum networks are already being planned.Science, this issue p. eaam9288BACKGROUNDThe internet has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to provide fundamentally new internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet will{\textemdash}in synergy with the {\textquotedblleft}classical{\textquotedblright} internet that we have today{\textemdash}connect quantum information processors in order to achieve unparalleled capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical information.As with any radically new technology, it is hard to predict all uses of the future quantum internet. However, several major applications have already been identified, including secure communication, clock synchronization, extending the baseline of telescopes, secure identification, achieving efficient agreement on distributed data, exponential savings in communication, quantum sensor networks, as well as secure access to remote quantum computers in the cloud.Central to all these applications is the ability of a quantum internet to transmit quantum bits (qubits) that are fundamentally different than classical bits. Whereas classical bits can take only two values, 0 or 1, qubits can be in a superposition of being 0 and 1 at the same time. Moreover, qubits can be entangled with each other, leading to correlations over large distances that are much stronger than is possible with classical information. Qubits also cannot be copied, and any attempt to do so can be detected. This feature makes qubits well suited for security applications but at the same time makes the transmission of qubits require radically new concepts and technology. Rapid experimental progress in recent years has brought first rudimentary quantum networks within reach, highlighting the timeliness and need for a unified framework for quantum internet researchers.ADVANCESWe define different stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet. We expect that this classification will be instrumental in guiding and assessing experimental progress as well as stimulating the development of new applications by providing a common language and reference frame for the different scientific and engineering disciplines involved.More advanced stages are distinguished by a larger amount of functionality, thus supporting ever more sophisticated application protocols. For each stage, we describe some of the application protocols that are already known and that can be realized with the functionality provided in that stage. It is conceivable that a simpler protocol, or better theoretical analysis, may be found in the future that solves the same task but is less demanding in terms of functionality. In parallel to the daunting experimental challenges in making quantum internet a reality, there is thus an opportunity for quantum software developers to design protocols that can realize a task in a stage that can be implemented more easily. We identify relevant parameters for each stage to establish a common language between hardware and software developers. Last, we review technological progress in experimental physics, engineering, and computer science that is required to attain such stages.OUTLOOKBuilding and scaling quantum networks is a formidable endeavor, requiring sustained and concerted efforts in physics, computer science, and engineering to succeed. The proposed stages of development will facilitate interdisciplinary communication by summarizing what we may actually want to achieve and providing guidelines both to protocol design and software development as well as hardware implementations through experimental physics and engineering. Although it is hard to predict what the exact components of a future quantum internet will be, it is likely that we will see the birth of the first multinode quantum networks in the next few years. This development brings the exciting opportunity to test all the ideas and functionalities that so far only exist on paper and may indeed be the dawn of a future large-scale quantum internet.Stages in the development of a quantum internet.Each stage is characterized by an increase in functionality at the expense of greater technological difficulty. This Review provides a clear definition of each stage, including benchmarks and examples of known applications, and provides an overview of the technological progress required to attain these stages.The internet{\textemdash}a vast network that enables simultaneous long-range classical communication{\textemdash}has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet may operate in parallel to the internet that we have today and connect quantum processors in order to achieve capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical means. Here, we propose stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet and highlight experimental and theoretical progress needed to attain them.},

We report on the realization of an atom-photon quantum interface based on an optical cavity, using it to entangle a single atom with a single photon and then to map the quantum state of the atom onto a second single photon. The latter step disentangles the atom from the light and produces an entangled photon pair. Our scheme is intrinsically deterministic and establishes the basic element required to realize a distributed quantum network with individual atoms at rest as quantum memories and single flying photons as quantum messengers.

Hypothesizing that recorded areas resulted from indigenous calculation, in a study of sample quadrilateral fields we found that 60% of the area values could be reproduced exactly by computation. In remaining cases, discrepancies between computed and recorded areas were consistently small, suggesting use of an unknown indigenous arithmetic. In revisiting the research, we discovered evidence for the use of congruence principles, based on proportions between the standard linear Acolhua measure and their units of shorter length. This procedure substitutes for computation with fractions and is labeled "Acolhua congruence arithmetic." The findings also clarify variance between Acolhua and Tenochca linear units, long an issue in understanding Aztec metrology.

Our ability to transmit information to and from living systems, and to process and act on information inside cells, is critical to advancing the scale and complexity at which we can engineer, manipulate, and probe biological systems. We developed a general approach for assembling RNA devices that can execute higher-order cellular information processing operations from standard components. The engineered devices can function as logic gates (AND, NOR, NAND, or OR gates) and signal filters, and exhibit cooperativity. RNA devices process and transmit molecular inputs to targeted protein outputs, linking computation to gene expression and thus the potential to control cellular function.

  abstract={Nuclear spin registers in the vicinity of electron spins in solid state systems offer a powerful resource to address the challenge of scalability in quantum architectures. We investigate here the properties of 29 Si nuclear spins surrounding donor atoms in silicon, and consider the use of such spins, combined with the donor nuclear spin, as a quantum register coupled to the donor electron spin. We find the coherence of the nearby 29 Si nuclear spins is effectively protected by the presence of the donor electron spin, leading to coherence times in the second timescale over two orders of magnitude greater than the coherence times in bulk silicon. We theoretically investigate the use of such a register for quantum error correction (QEC), including methods to protect nuclear spins from the ionisation/neutralisation of the donor, which is necessary for the re-initialisation of the ancillae qubits. This provides a route for multi-round QEC using donors in silicon.}

	abstract={Recent advances in quantum information science enabled the development of quantum communication network prototypes and created an opportunity to study full-stack quantum network architectures. This work develops SeQUeNCe, a comprehensive, customizable quantum network simulator. Our simulator consists of five modules: Hardware models, Entanglement Management protocols, Resource Management, Network Management, and Application. This framework is suitable for simulation of quantum network prototypes that capture the breadth of current and future hardware technologies and protocols. We implement a comprehensive suite of network protocols and demonstrate the use of SeQUeNCe by simulating a photonic quantum network with nine routers equipped with quantum memories. The simulation capabilities are illustrated in three use cases. We show the dependence of quantum network throughput on several key hardware parameters and study the impact of classical control message latency. We also investigate quantum memory usage efficiency in routers and demonstrate that redistributing memory according to anticipated load increases network capacity by 69.1\% and throughput by 6.8\%. We design SeQUeNCe to enable comparisons of alternative quantum network technologies, experiment planning, and validation and to aid with new protocol design. We are releasing SeQUeNCe as an open source tool and aim to generate community interest in extending it.}

abstract="In this paper, the issue of swapping quantum entanglements in two arbitrary biqubit pure states via a local bipartite entangledstate projective measure in the middle node is studied in depth, especially with regard to quantitative aspects. Attention is mainly focused on the relation between the measure and the final entanglement obtained via swapping. During the study, the entanglement of formation (EoF) is employed as a quantifier to characterize and quantify the entanglements present in all involved states. All concerned EoFs are expressed analytically; thus, the relation between the final entanglement and the measuring state is established. Through concrete analyses, the measure demands for getting a certain amount of a final entanglement are revealed. It is found that a maximally entangled final state can be obtained from any two given initial entangled states via swapping with a certain probability; however, a peculiar measure should be performed. Moreover, some distinct properties are revealed and analyzed. Such a study will be useful in quantum information processes.",

abstract = {Quantum dots are typically formed from large groupings of atoms and thus may be expected to have appreciable many-body behavior under intense optical excitation. Nonetheless, they are known to exhibit discrete energy levels due to quantum confinement effects. We show that, like single-atom or single-molecule two- and three-level quantum systems, single semiconductor quantum dots can also exhibit interference phenomena when driven simultaneously by two optical fields. Probe absorption spectra are obtained that exhibit Autler-Townes splitting when the optical fields drive coupled transitions and complex Mollow-related structure, including gain without population inversion, when they drive the same transition. Our results open the way for the demonstration of numerous quantum levelbased applications, such as quantum dot lasers, optical modulators, and quantum logic devices.

abstract={In the near future, the performance growth of Neumann-architecture computers will slow down due to the end of semiconductor scaling. Presently a new computing paradigm, so-called natural computing, which maps problems to physical models and solves the problem by its own convergence property, is expected. The analog computer using superconductivity from D-Wave [1] is one of those computers. A neuron chip [2] is also one of them. We proposed a CMOS-type Ising computer [3]. The Ising computer maps problems to an Ising model, a model to express the behavior of magnetic spins (the upper left diagram in Fig. 24.3.1), and solves the problems by ground-state search operations. The energy of the system is expressed by the formula in the diagram. Computing flows are expressed in the lower flow chart in Fig. 24.3.1. In the conventional Neumann architecture, the problem is sequentially and repeatedly calculated, and therefore, the number of computing steps drastically increases as the problem size grows. In the Ising computer, in the first step, the problem is mapped to the Ising model. In the next steps, an annealing operation, the ground-state search by interactions between spins, are activated and the state transitions to the ground state where the energy of the system is minimized. The interacting operation between spins is decided by the interaction coefficients, which are set to each connection. Here, the configuration of the interaction coefficients is decided by the problem, and therefore, the interaction coefficients are equivalent to the programming in the conventional computing paradigm. The ground state corresponds to the solution of the original problem, and the solution is acquired by observing the ground state. The interactions for the annealing are performed in parallel, and the necessary steps for the annealing are smaller than that used by a sequential computing, Neumann architecture. As the table in Fig. 24.3.1, our Ising computer uses CMOS circuits to expre- s the Ising model, and acquires the scalability and operation at room temperature.},

                  used for retrieving astronomical information from an
                  array of telescopes. However, optic loss in the
                  baseline severely limits the length of baseline and
                  thus limits the resolution of interferometers. In
                  this paper, we consider the elimination of optic
                  loss with quantum noiseless linear amplification
                  (NLA). With a success probability of 1.98e-3, one
                  could implement a 100km long baseline interferometry
                  via 1550nm quantum communication. This shows the
                  power quantum information technique and its
                  application in astronomic interferometry. Finally,

When the measurements of different time intervals are combined, the errors due to the finite clock size accumulate, resulting in an overall inaccuracy that grows with the complexity of the set-up. Here, we introduce a method that, in principle, eludes the accumulation of errors by coherently transferring information from a quantum clock to a quantum memory of the smallest possible size. Our method could be used to measure the total duration of a sequence of events with enhanced accuracy, and to reduce the amount of quantum communication needed to stabilize clocks in a quantum network.},

	abstract = {A successful quantum communication network will rely on the ability to distribute entangled photons over large distances between receiver stations. So far, free-space demonstrations have been limited to line-of-sight links across cities or between mountaintops. Scattering and coherence decay have limited the link separations to around 100 km. Yin et al. used the Micius satellite, which was launched last year and is equipped with a specialized quantum optical payload. They successfully demonstrated the satellite-based entanglement distribution to receiver stations separated by more than 1200 km. The results illustrate the possibility of a future global quantum communication network.Science, this issue p. 1140Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 {\textpm} 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.},

                  notes that you can parallelize multiplication, but
                  dismisses the space tradeoff as too expensive.
                  Comes up with about the same result as me, that
                  FFT-based multiplication will be faster for 8kb or
                  above (I found 32kb, but slightly different
                  assumptions).  He seems to have independently
                  arrived at carry-select arithmetic, without knowing
                  what it is or calling it by name.  Has done the work
                  to make Schonhage-Strassen reversible.
                  Disrecommends Karatsuba because of the space
                  consumption, but I think FFT will take a bunch, too,
                  unless he's got that straight.  Claims 24L-96L
                  qubits needed for S-S?  Claims for large L,
                  std. algo. can be improved to $600L^2$ Toffoli gate
                  times and $52L^3$ total gates in a space of $5L$.
                  Estimates S-S delay at $2^{17}L^{1.2}$ and total
                  gate count at $2^{17}L^2$.  Says carry-select is
                  $13L$ Toffoli gate times, but I disagree with his
                  analysis.}

abstract = {Subkelvin refrigeration refers to the refrigeration below 1 K and is widely used in the fields of condensed-matter physics, quantum computing, and astronomical observation. Among the three conventional technologies, adsorption refrigeration, adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, and dilution refrigeration, dilution refrigeration is the most popular with the advantages of lowest temperature down to several mK, continuous cooling, and relatively large cooling power. The method was first proposed in the 1950s and the first complete system was built in 1960s, followed by a successful commercialization. Since then, with the ever-increasing demands of low temperature physics research and due to its apparent advantages, it quickly becomes the most important technique to reach the millikelvin temperature range. The lowest temperature achievable nowadays by a conventional dilution refrigeration is 1.75 mK, and largest cooling power at 100 mK is 2 mW. In addition to the commercialization of dilution refrigeration, lots of other research, tailored to special applications, have also been done or going on, which include cold-cycle dilution refrigeration without room-temperature pumping system and zero-g dilution refrigeration for space applications, etc. The cold-cycle dilution refrigerator on the ground, driven by two adsorption pumps, can reach a minimum temperature of 8 mK and the corresponding cooling power was 60 μW at 110 mK. For zero-g space applications, an open-cycle dilution refrigerator was successfully operated in space for 2.5 years with a cooling power of 0.1 μW at 92.6 mK. Closed-cycle dilution refrigerators for zero-g environment are still under investigation. With a brief introduction on the thermodynamics of dilution refrigeration, this paper reviews the development of the conventional 3He-circulating dilution refrigerator, the 4He-circulating dilution refrigerator, the cold-cycle dilution refrigerator on the ground, and dilution refrigerators for space. Key issues related to non-conventional dilution refrigeration are pointed out with some discussions on their prospects.}

abstract={Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology which, compared to conventional computation, allows for substantial speed-ups e.g. for integer factorization or database search. However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present. In this work, we revisit the basics of quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as graph-based). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution is capable of simulating quantum computations for more qubits than before, and in significantly less run-time (several magnitudes faster compared to previously proposed simulators). An implementation of the proposed simulator is publicly available online at http://www.jku.at/iic/eda/quantum_simulation.},

  abstract={Quantum repeaters provide an efficient solution to distribute Bell pairs over arbitrarily long distances. While scalable architectures are demanding regarding the number of qubits that need to be controlled, here we present a quantum repeater scheme aiming to extend the range of present day quantum communications that could be implemented in the near future with trapped ions in cavities. We focus on an architecture where ion-photon entangled states are created locally and subsequently processed with linear optics to create elementary links of ion-ion entangled states. These links are then used to distribute entangled pairs over long distances using successive entanglement swapping operations performed using deterministic ion-ion gates. We show how this architecture can be implemented while encoding the qubits in a decoherence-free subspace to protect them against collective dephasing. This results in a protocol that can be used to violate a Bell inequality over distances of about 800 km assuming state-of-the-art parameters. We discuss how this could be improved to several thousand kilometres in future setups.}

  comment = {Paper summary:
\par
Primarily, this paper shows how to implement known purify-and-swap protocols using measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC).  There are some novel constructions here, including some combined operations that give lower success protocols but much lower latency when they succeed.  The combined purify-and-swap operation probably uses the standard quantum wire protocol but requires a new classical support protocol that handles the combined operations.
\par
Because the operations that e.g. combine two rounds of purification into one use smaller MBQC graph states, they tolerate higher local errors (and lower Bell pair fidelities?) that performing the operations separately.
\par
Requires:
* high fidelity local gates: moderate
* high entanglement probability: apparently no, but not discussed in detail
* high entanglement fidelity: no
* long memory lifetime: generally, reduced from full purify-and-swap due to integrated operations reducing round trips

                  Separate control and data connections.  Begins with
                  a setup negotiation, in which the destination
                  indicates how much data it's prepared to receive.
                  Mentions that this could be adjusted downward by
                  intermediate nodes, but no discussion of how.
                  Assumes very reliable in-order delivery for
                  efficiency, though should work on packet loss due to
                  ACKs (apparently, one ACK per data pkt is required).
                  Targetted to minimize the work on receive.
                  Transfers consist of blocks which consist of STUs,
                  which I think correspond to packets.  Must be a
                  power of two in size.  Some support for striping,
                  including fan-in and fan-out, but still looks incomplete.
                  Headers indicate when the upper-layer system should
                  be interrupted.  Some support for negotiated
                  out-of-order delivery, but I'm not sure how that
                  works with the max received index in the ACK packets
                  (ACK pkts are primarily indicators of buffer
                  availability for flow control, really CTS).  Says it
                  assumes low latency.  No discussion of how packets
                  might overlap in transmission; diagrams show a
                  series of data pkts then a series of CTSes.  Thinks
                  it ld be used to carry TCP/IP traffic, but I view it
                  more as a transport protocol and would be curious to
                  see ST over IP.  Despite not being an Internet

  read/write smaller sections of the arrays from/to files. We
  describe a runtime method for accessing sections of
  out-of-core arrays efficiently. This method, called the
  {\em extended two-phase method}, uses collective I/O in
  which processors cooperate to read/write out-of-core data
  in an efficient manner. The I/O workload is divided among
  processors dynamically, depending on the access requests.
  Performance results on the Intel Touchstone Delta show
  that  the extended two-phase method performs considerably
  better than a direct method for different access patterns,
  array sizes, and number of processors. We have used the
  extended two-phase method in the PASSION runtime library

  concurrent video streams competing for I/O node resources,
  cache effects, and video striping across multiple I/O

  promising approach to alleviating this bottleneck is to

\par  
  Although centralized algorithms for batch scheduling of

  they are not be appropriate for all applications and
  architectures.  We develop a class of decentralized
  algorithms for scheduling parallel I/O operations, where
  the objective is to reduce the time required to complete a

  edge-coloring and matching of bipartite graphs, rely upon
  simple heuristics to obtain shorter schedules.  We present
  simulation results indicating that the best of our
  algorithms can produce schedules whose length (or makespan)
  is within 2 - 20\% of the optimal schedule, a substantial
  improvement on previous decentralized algorithms.  We
  discuss theoretical and experimental work in progress and

  To realize the high reliability, nodes in a sub-network

  for calculating parity keeps the locality of data
  transfer, and it inhibits bottlenecks from occurring,

  architectural idea in SWIM is to associate some processing logic with
  each memory chip that allows it to perform data manipulation
  operations locally and to communicate with a disk or a communication
  line through a backend port.  The processing logic is specially
  designed to perform operations such as pointer dereferencing, memory
  indirection, searching and bounds checking efficiently. The I/O
  subsystem is built using an interconnected ensemble of such memory
  logic pairs. A complex processing task can now be distributed between
  a large number of small memory processors each doing a sub-task, while
  still retaining a common locus of control in the host CPU for higher
  level administrative and provisioning functions.  We argue that active
  memory based processing enables more powerful, scalable and robust
  designs for storage and communications subsystems, that can support
  emerging network services, multimedia workstations and wireless PCS
  systems. A complete parallel hardware and software system constructed
  using an array of SWIM elements has been operational for over a
  year. We present results from application of SWIM to three network
  functions: a national phone database server, a high performance IP

    This paper tries to proof that server traces have temporal as well as
    spatial locality. Temporal locality is measured by marginal distribution
    which is the likelihood of a certain inter-reference distance. Spatial
    locality is measured by correlation structure which is the likelihood
    that future reference can be predicted based on a stream of past
    references. They show that a popularity profile abstracts
    over locality properties: scrambling a trace preserves its popularity
    profile while changing its locality properties. Their proof of existence
    of temporal locality is that a scrambled trace has a higher mean (LRU) stac
k
    distance than an unscrambled one. The existence proof for spatial locality
    is similar but considering the number of unique sequences instead of stack
    distance. According to their data a client trace has a higher spatial
    locality than a server trace than a scrambled server trace. Temporal 
    locality is characterized as a lognormal distribution. Spatial locality
    is modelled as a fractal of significantly > 0.5-self-similarity 
    (0.5-self-similarity has no long-range dependencies = Gaussian noise).
    Thus, they show that the correlation structure of server traces bear
    long range dependencies. Furthermore, they show how to generate
    synthetic traces based on their findings."

                 (used for prefetching) instead of reads (and, of
                 course, it does not produce output). If the speculative
                 thread appears to stray from the normal execution path
                 or fall behind, it is reinitialized from the current
                 state of the main thread. This idea has been tested on
                 three read-intensive programs and produced 29\%--70\%
                 speedup on a machine with a 4-disk RAID~0 (fewer disks
                 produce less speedup, more disks hardly more). If the
                 hints were ignored, the slowdown was 1\%--4\%,
                 indicating that the scheme costs little if it is
                 useless; however, the Gnuld benchmark had a 15\%
                 slowdown when using the hints with one disk, apparently
                 because scarce disk bandwidth is wasted on useless
                 prefetches. For two of the benchmarks the hints are
                 quite accurate, but for Gnuld many hints caused
                 prefetches of useless blocks, and useful blocks were
                 not prefetched; Gnuld was also the only benchmark where
                 manual prefetching seriously outperformed the new
                 technique.",

                 understanding of the application access pattern,

                 important for optimizing file system performance. We
                 propose a method for automatically classifying these

                 classifications to select and tune file system policies
                 to improve input/output performance. We demonstrate
                 this approach on benchmarks and scientific applications

                 queries but indexes are large, typically 50\% to 300\%

                 space; its indexes are typically 2\% to 4\% of
                 collection size. Uses 2-level-searching: index provides
                 pointers to *area* where info' may be found, not
                 precise location. The area is then searched
                 sequentially. Uses agrep to search both the index and
                 the local files. This allows approx' matching and
                 regular expressions. http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu/
