abstract="Despite their popularity, lattice reduction algorithms remain mysterious cryptanalytical tools. Though it has been widely reported that they behave better than their proved worst-case theoretical bounds, no precise assessment has ever been given. Such an assessment would be very helpful to predict the behaviour of lattice-based attacks, as well as to select keysizes for lattice-based cryptosystems. The goal of this paper is to provide such an assessment, based on extensive experiments performed with the NTL library. The experiments suggest several conjectures on the worst case and the actual behaviour of lattice reduction algorithms. We believe the assessment might also help to design new reduction algorithms overcoming the limitations of current algorithms.",

abstract="Despite their popularity, lattice reduction algorithms remain mysterious in many ways. It has been widely reported that they behave much more nicely than what was expected from the worst-case proved bounds, both in terms of the running time and the output quality. In this article, we investigate this puzzling statement by trying to model the average case of lattice reduction algorithms, starting with the celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov{\'a}sz algorithm (L3). We discuss what is meant by lattice reduction on the average, and we present extensive experiments on the average case behavior of L3, in order to give a clearer picture of the differences/similarities between the average and worst cases. Our work is intended to clarify the practical behavior of L3 and to raise theoretical questions on its average behavior.",

abstract="We present a new and fast method, called the cross-entropy method, for finding the optimal solution of combinatorial and continuous nonconvex optimization problems with convex bounded domains. To find the optimal solution we solve a sequence of simple auxiliary smooth optimization problems based on Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy, importance sampling, Markov chain and Boltzmann distribution. We use importance sampling as an important ingredient for adaptive adjustment of the temperature in the Boltzmann distribution and use Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy to find the optimal solution. In fact, we use the mode of a unimodal importance sampling distribution, like the mode of beta distribution, as an estimate of the optimal solution for continuous optimization and Markov chains approach for combinatorial optimization. In the later case we show almost surely convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution. Supporting numerical results for both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems are given as well. Our empirical studies suggest that the cross-entropy method has polynomial in the size of the problem running time complexity.",

abstract="The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since over twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem (SVP) is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on which rely the best known generic attacks against the lattice-based encryption schemes mentioned above. In this paper we improve the complexity upper-bounds of Kannan's algorithms. The analysis provides new insight on the practical cost of solving?SVP, and helps progressing towards providing meaningful key-sizes.",

abstract="The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov{\'a}sz lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL or L3) is a very popular tool in public-key cryptanalysis and in many other fields. Given an integer d-dimensional lattice basis with vectors of norm less than?B in an n-dimensional space, L3 outputs a so-called L3-reduced basis in polynomial time O(d                5                n log3                B), using arithmetic operations on integers of bit-length O(d log B). This worst-case complexity is problematic for lattices arising in cryptanalysis where d or/and log B are often large. As a result, the original L3 is almost never used in practice. Instead, one applies floating-point variants of L3, where the long-integer arithmetic required by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation (central in L3) is replaced by floating-point arithmetic. Unfortunately, this is known to be unstable in the worst-case: the usual floating-point L3 is not even guaranteed to terminate, and the output basis may not be L3-reduced at all. In this article, we introduce the L2?algorithm, a new and natural floating-point variant of L3 which provably outputs L3-reduced bases in polynomial time O(d                4                n (d + log B) log B). This is the first L3 algorithm whose running time (without fast integer arithmetic) provably grows only quadratically with respect to log B, like the well-known Euclidean and Gaussian algorithms, which it generalizes.",

abstract="We provide an alternative method for constructing lattice-based digital signatures which does not use the ``hash-and-sign'' methodology of Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2008). Our resulting signature scheme is secure, in the random oracle model, based on the worst-case hardness of the {\~O}(n                1.5)-SIVP problem in general lattices. The secret key, public key, and the signature size of our scheme are smaller than in all previous instantiations of the hash-and-sign signature, and our signing algorithm is also quite simple, requiring just a few matrix-vector multiplications and rejection samplings. We then also show that by slightly changing the parameters, one can get even more efficient signatures that are based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. Our construction naturally transfers to the ring setting, where the size of the public and secret keys can be significantly shrunk, which results in the most practical to-date provably secure signature scheme based on lattices.",

The main cryptographic application of our work is the proof that the Ajtai-Dwork ([2]) and the Regev ([33]) cryptosystems, which were previously only known to be based on the hardness of uSVP, can be equivalently based on the hardness of worst-case GapSVP                                                                          {\$}{\{}{\_}{\{}O({\{}n^{\{}2.5{\}}{\}}){\}}{\}}{\$}                 and GapSVP                                                                          {\$}{\{}{\_}{\{}O(n^{\{}2{\}}){\}}{\}}{\$}                , respectively.

abstract="At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first completely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even stronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be achievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption circuits.",

This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract="The security of code-based cryptosystems such as the McEliece cryptosystem relies primarily on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes. The best decoding algorithms are all improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange: they are known under the name of information set decoding techniques. It is also important to assess the security of such cryptosystems against a quantum computer. This research thread started in [23] and the best algorithm to date has been Bernstein's quantising [5] of the simplest information set decoding algorithm, namely Prange's algorithm. It consists in applying Grover's quantum search to obtain a quadratic speed-up of Prange's algorithm. In this paper, we quantise other information set decoding algorithms by using quantum walk techniques which were devised for the subset-sum problem in [6]. This results in improving the worst-case complexity of {\$}{\$}2^{\{}0.06035n{\}}{\$}{\$}of Bernstein's algorithm to {\$}{\$}2^{\{}0.05869n{\}}{\$}{\$}with the best algorithm presented here (where n is the codelength).",

abstract="We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.",

abstract = {Computational complexity is one of the most beautiful fields of modern mathematics, and it is increasingly relevant to other sciences ranging from physics to biology. But this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results like interactive proofs, cryptography, and quantum computing are usually considered too "advanced" to show to the typical student. The aim of this book is to bridge both gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear and enjoyable fashion, making them accessible to non computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to understand what their formalisms are actually telling. This book gives a lucid and playful explanation of the field, starting with P and NP-completeness. The authors explain why the P vs. NP problem is so fundamental, and why it is so hard to resolve. They then lead the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimization in theory and practice; randomized algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible. The book is intended for graduates and undergraduates, scientists from other areas who have long wanted to understand this subject, and experts who want to fall in love with this field all over again.}

abstract = {The claw finding problem has been studied in terms of query complexity as one of the problems closely connected to cryptography. Given two functions, f and g, with domain sizes N and M(N@?M), respectively, and the same range, the goal of the problem is to find x and y such that f(x)=g(y). This problem has been considered in both quantum and classical settings in terms of query complexity. This paper describes an optimal algorithm that uses quantum walk to solve this problem. Our algorithm can be slightly modified to solve the more general problem of finding a tuple consisting of elements in the two function domains that has a prespecified property. It can also be generalized to find a claw of k functions for any constant integer k>1, where the domain sizes of the functions may be different.},

abstract="Enumeration is a fundamental lattice algorithm. We show how to speed up enumeration on a quantum computer, which affects the security estimates of several lattice-based submissions to NIST: if T is the number of operations of enumeration, our quantum enumeration runs in roughly {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}T{\}}{\$}{\$}operations. This applies to the two most efficient forms of enumeration known in the extreme pruning setting: cylinder pruning but also discrete pruning introduced at Eurocrypt '17. Our results are based on recent quantum tree algorithms by Montanaro and Ambainis-Kokainis. The discrete pruning case requires a crucial tweak: we modify the preprocessing so that the running time can be rigorously proved to be essentially optimal, which was the main open problem in discrete pruning. We also introduce another tweak to solve the more general problem of finding close lattice vectors.",

abstract="Recently, Ajtai discovered a fascinating connection between the worst-case complexity and the average-case complexity of some wellknown lattice problems. Later, Ajtai and Dwork proposed a cryptosystem inspired by Ajtai's work, provably secure if a particular lattice problem is difficult in the worst-case. We present a heuristic attack (to recover the private key) against this celebrated cryptosystem. Experiments with this attack suggest that in order to be secure, implementations of the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem would require very large keys, making it impractical in a real-life environment. We also adopt a theoretical point of view: we show that there is a converse to the Ajtai-Dwork security result, by reducing the question of distinguishing encryptions of one from encryptions of zero to approximating some lattice problems. In particular, this settles the open question regarding the NP-hardness of the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem: from a recent result of Goldreich and Goldwasser, our result shows that breaking the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is not NP-hard, assuming the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse.",

abstract = {The “learning with errors” (LWE) problem is to distinguish random linear equations, which have been perturbed by a small amount of noise, from truly uniform ones. The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).We resolve this question in the affirmative by introducing an algebraic variant of LWE called ring-LWE, and proving that it too enjoys very strong hardness guarantees. Specifically, we show that the ring-LWE distribution is pseudorandom, assuming that worst-case problems on ideal lattices are hard for polynomial-time quantum algorithms. Applications include the first truly practical lattice-based public-key cryptosystem with an efficient security reduction; moreover, many of the other applications of LWE can be made much more efficient through the use of ring-LWE.},

Our second contribution is to show that the security of all schemes of this type depends on the difficulty of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. This result gives significant insight into the difficulty of the isogeny problem that underlies the security of these schemes. Our third contribution is to give a reduction that uses partial knowledge of shared keys to determine an entire shared key. This can be used to retrieve the secret key, given information leaked from a side-channel attack on the key exchange protocol. A corollary of this work is the first bit security result for the supersingular isogeny key exchange: Computing any component of the j-invariant is as hard as computing the whole j-invariant.",

year = {1979},
month = {October},
abstract = {At a coffee house in Berkeley around 1975, Whitfield Diffie described a problem to me that he had been trying to solve: constructing a digital signature for a document. I immediately proposed a solution. Though not very practical--it required perhaps 64 bits of published key to sign a single bit--it was the first digital signature algorithm. Diffie and Hellman mention it in their classic paper:

Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman. New Directions in Cryptography. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory IT-22, 6 (1976), 644-654.
(I think it's at the bottom right of page 650.)

In 1978, Michael Rabin published a paper titled Digitalized Signatures containing a more practical scheme for generating digital signatures of documents. (I don't remember what other digital signature algorithms had already been proposed.) However, his solution had some drawbacks that limited its utility. This report describes an improvement to Rabin's algorithm that eliminates those drawbacks.

I'm not sure why I never published this report. However, I think it was because, after writing it, I realized that the algorithm could be fairly easily derived directly from Rabin's algorithm. So, I didn't feel that it added much to what Rabin had done. However, I've been told that this paper is cited in the cryptography literature and is considered significant, so perhaps I was wrong.},
