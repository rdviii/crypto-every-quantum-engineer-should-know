At a conference in Berlin in June, I was asked, paraphrasing, about
why we change the cryptographic keys used during long communication
sessions, and how often they _ought_ to be changed.  I waved my hands
a little bit, but I wasn't completely satisfied with my own answer.
It turned out to be a good opportunity for me to dig into a little
background I'd been meaning to go through.  It also proved to be a
*remarkably* hard question to answer from googling up pages, including
cryptography research papers and the _extensive_ mailing list archives
from development of key Internet protocols.  I fell down a pretty
serious rabbit hole here, and haven't found my way out yet.

What I have wound up with is about 25 pages of notes on classical
cryptography, and I have decided to turn them into something that will
benefit the quantum community at large.  I'm tentatively titling it,
"What Every Quantum Researcher and Engineer Should Know about
Classical Cryptography", in homage to Goldberg's classic paper on
floating point arithmetic.

The target audience for this is primarily quantum computing
researchers who are familiar with Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm
and QKD, since those are among the first things you learn, but who
have only a very rough idea of what it means to actually encrypt data
and to use encryption in a real-world setting.

I'll be posting the notes gradually over the next few weeks here on
this blog, and I hope you will comment and help me improve them.
