abstract = "Abstract The appealing feature of quantum key distribution (QKD), from a cryptographic viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, \{QKD\} however does not provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established by \{QKD\} are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating \{QKD\} in security infrastructures, to analyze how \{QKD\} can be combined with other cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment techniques, \{QKD\} being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic scenarios related to the practical use of \{QKD\} in cryptographic infrastructures: 1) using \{QKD\} as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a point-to-point link; 2) using \{QKD\} in a network containing many users with the objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the constraints as well as the potential interest of using \{QKD\} in these contexts. We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of \{QKD\} technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research. "

abstract="The ideas of completeness and the avalanche effect were first introduced by Kam and Davida [1] and Feistel [2], respectively. If a cryptographic transformation is complete, then each ciphertext bit must depend on all of the plaintext bits. Thus, if it were possible to find the simplest Boolean expression for each ciphertext bit in terms of the plaintext bits, each of those expressions would have to contain all of the plaintext bits if the function was complete. Alternatively, if there is at least one pair of n-bit plaintext vectors X and Xi that differ only in bit i, and f(X) and f(Xi) differ at least in bit j for all {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{} (i,j)|1 {\backslash}leqslant i,j {\backslash}leqslant n{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}then the function f must be complete.",
