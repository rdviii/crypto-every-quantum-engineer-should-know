abstract = "Abstract The appealing feature of quantum key distribution (QKD), from a cryptographic viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, \{QKD\} however does not provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established by \{QKD\} are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating \{QKD\} in security infrastructures, to analyze how \{QKD\} can be combined with other cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment techniques, \{QKD\} being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic scenarios related to the practical use of \{QKD\} in cryptographic infrastructures: 1) using \{QKD\} as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a point-to-point link; 2) using \{QKD\} in a network containing many users with the objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the constraints as well as the potential interest of using \{QKD\} in these contexts. We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of \{QKD\} technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research. "

If a cryptographic transformation is complete, then each ciphertext bit must depend on all of the plaintext bits. Thus, if it were possible to find the simplest Boolean expression for each ciphertext bit in terms of the plaintext bits, each of those expressions would have to contain all of the plaintext bits if the function was complete. Alternatively, if there is at least one pair of n-bit plaintext vectors X and Xi that differ only in bit i, and f(X) and f(Xi) differ at least in bit j for all {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{} (i,j)|1 {\backslash}leqslant i,j {\backslash}leqslant n{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}then the function f must be complete.",

abstract = {Quantum computing is threatening current cryptography, especially the asymmetric algorithms used in many Internet protocols. More secure algorithms, colloquially referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), are under active development. These new algorithms differ significantly from current ones. They can have larger signatures or keys, and often require more computational power. This means we cannot just replace existing algorithms by PQC alternatives, but need to evaluate if they meet the requirements of the Internet protocols that rely on them.In this paper we provide a case study, analyzing the impact of PQC on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In its main role, DNS translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses and DNSSEC guarantees message integrity and authenticity. DNSSEC is particularly challenging to transition to PQC, since DNSSEC and its underlying transport protocols require small signatures and keys and efficient validation. We evaluate current candidate PQC signature algorithms in the third round of the NIST competition on their suitability for use in DNSSEC. We show that three algorithms, partially, meet DNSSEC's requirements but also show where and how we would still need to adapt DNSSEC. Thus, our research lays the foundation for making DNSSEC, and protocols with similar constraints ready for PQC.},
